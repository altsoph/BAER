This [bedroom] is extremely spare, with [dirty laundry] scattered haphazardly all over the floor. Cleaner [clothing] can be found in the [dresser]. A [bathroom] lies to the south, while a [door] to the east leads to the [living room].
This is a far from luxurious but still quite functional [bathroom], with a [sink, toilet and shower]. The [bedroom] lies to the north.
The [furniture] isn't as carefully arranged as one might like, and it's a bit lacking in the luxuries that might make this a more pleasant place to spend an evening - no stereo, no TV, no DVD, none of that - but this [living room] is still nicer than most of those in this neighborhood. A [kitchenette] lies to the east, the [bedroom] to the west and the front [door] to the south.
This is quite a seedy neighborhood, but there isn't really anywhere in the whole Las Mesas metro area that isn't at least a little rundown. Of course, the locals may complain about the ugliness and the crime, but the fact is that a [starter home] like this one would cost easily five times as much in someplace like Las Playas - and that's if you could find one.
A good sized [courtyard] with an air of late British colonialism about it. To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey [stone wall] with an ornate [iron gate] set into the rock. The [walls] of a large [stone] mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south. In the east [wall, two] or [three] stories up, is a large [window]. On top of the west [wall], above and to the right of the [gate], is a large [squirrels nest] made of [sticks, twigs, and leaves].
You are standing at the end of a [road] before a [small brick building]. Around you is a [forest]. A [small stream] flows out of the [building] and down a gully.
You are inside a [building], a [well house] for a [large spring].
You are in a valley in the [forest] beside a [stream tumbling] along a [rocky bed].
At your feet all the [water] of the [stream] splashes into a [2-inch slit] in the rock. Downstream the [streambed] is bare rock.
You are in a [20-foot] [depression] floored with [bare dirt]. Set into the [dirt] is a [strong steel grate] mounted in concrete. A dry streambed leads into the [depression].
You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 [steel grate] to the surface. A low crawl over [cobbles] leads inward to the west.
You are crawling over [cobbles] in a low passage. There is a dim [light] at the east end of the passage.
At your feet is a [small pit] breathing traces of [white mist]. A west passage ends here except for a [small crack] leading on.
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to the west. There are openings to either side. Nearby, a [wide stone staircase] leads downward. The hall is filled with [wisps of white mist] swaying to and fro almost as if alive. A cold wind blows up the [staircase]. There is a passage at the top of a [dome] behind you.
This is a low room with a [crude note] on the wall:
You are in a [large] room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the west, and a wall of broken [rock] to the east. There is a [large] "Y2" on a [rock] in the room's center.
You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese. Obvious passages go west, east, ne, and nw. Part of the room is occupied by a [large bedrock block].
You are at the east end of the twopit room. The floor here is littered with [thin rock slabs], which make it easy to descend the [pits]. There is a path here bypassing the [pits] to connect passages from east and west. There are [holes] all over, but the only big one is on the wall directly over the west [pit] where you can't get to it.
You are at the west end of the twopit room. There is a [large hole] in the wall [above] the [pit] at this end of the room.
There is a [tiny little plant] in the [pit, murmuring] "[Water, water], ..."
This is the [oriental] room. [Ancient oriental cave drawings] cover the walls. A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern. Far below, through a heavy [white mist], strange splashing noises can be heard. The [mist] rises up through a [fissure] in the [ceiling]. The path exits to the south and west.
You are in the soft room. The walls are covered with [heavy curtains], the floor with a [thick pile carpet]. [Moss] covers the ceiling.
You are in a large room full of [dusty rocks]. There is a big hole in the floor. There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
You are at the bottom of the eastern [pit] in the twopit room. There is a [small pool of oil] in one corner of the [pit].
You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the west. At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a [profusion of leaves].
You are in the giant room. The [ceiling] here is too high up for your [lamp] to show it. Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south. On the west wall is [scrawled] the [inscription], "Fee fie foe foo" (sic).
You are in a magnificent cavern with a [rushing stream], which cascades over a [sparkling waterfall] into a roaring [whirlpool] which disappears through a hole in the floor. Passages exit to the south and west.
A [rickety] wooden [bridge] extends across the chasm, vanishing into the [mist].
You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with [oddly shaped limestone formations].
You are standing at the entrance to a large, [barren room]. A [sign] posted above the entrance reads: "[Caution]! Bear in [room]!"
There is a [ferocious cave bear] eyeing you from the far end of the room! The [bear] is held back by a [solid gold chain].
You are being followed by a very [large, tame bear].
There is an enormous [clam] here with its shell tightly closed.
You are at a [crossover] of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
You are at the west end of the hall of [mists]. A low wide crawl continues west and another goes north. To the south is a little passage 6 feet off the floor.
You are on the west side of the [fissure] in the hall of mists.
You are on the brink of a [thirty foot pit] with a [massive orange column] down one wall. You could climb down here but you could not get back up. The maze continues at this level.
You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even [larger] than the [giant] room. It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure" program. Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky yellow light. Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of [oysters], a bundle of [black rods] with [rusty stars] on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns. Off to one side a great many [dwarves] are [sleeping] on the floor, [snoring] loudly. A sign nearby reads: "Do not disturb the [dwarves]!"
You are at the southwest end of the repository. To one side is a pit full of fierce green snakes. On the other side is a row of [small] wicker cages, each of which contains a [little] sulking [bird]. In one corner is a bundle of [black rods] with [rusty marks] on their ends. A [large] number of [velvet pillows] are scattered about on the floor. A vast [mirror] stretches off to the northeast. At your feet is a [large steel grate], next to which is a sign which reads, "TREASURE VAULT. Keys in main office."
You are standing in front of Nikolai's Bar and Grill on 19th Street. A [green awning] shades the smudged [window] into Nikolai's [dining room]. The front [entrance] is north of you.
A street-front [window] looks into Nikolai's [bar]. If you want into the [bar], you'll have to go back to the restaurant entrance, which is west of here. There are no cars on this end of 19th Street. The [sidewalk] is uneven. A [curb]-side [storm gutter] empties here into a [grated] [storm drain].
The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top [tables], many still littered with yesterday's [crumbs]. A larger [bar] area--the primary source of revenue here--lies to the east. A rickety [staircase] leads to small [balcony outside] Nikolai's office [loft]. A wide [mirror] is mounted on the [wall] high above, [right] near his office [entrance].
Sunlight from the [19th Street window] (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the [cork dance] floor. In every other corner, the [brick walls] of this unpretentious watering hole are [marked] by [shadows]. If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's [dining room] is to the west. Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low [ceiling tunnel].
The low [ceiling] restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and bile. Its only fixtures are a porcelain [toilet, hand sink, soap dispenser and automatic hand dryer], all mounted low to the floor as if they were reclaimed from an abandoned grade school, or this lavatory was designed for alcoholic ten-year-olds.
You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide enough for one person to turn around. On the south side facing the dining room is a [wooden prep table]. On the [left] end of the [prep table] is a [mini fridge], and on the [right] end is a [steam table].
Nikolai's walk-in refrigerator is kept at a few degrees above zero Celsius. The tight dimensions of this poorly lit unit induce a sense of claustrophobia. The textured metal [walls] are splashed with now dry [remnants] of long ago [dinner specials].
On entering the [dish] room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell of fresh [bleach]. You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation, except that in such high concentrations [bleach] is actually toxic. Already you're feeling a little nauseous. A hall winds south into the darkness.
The edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated [cobweb nets], making it look more like a small cave than an urban underground. Moldy [pylons] and concrete [extrusions] resemble [stalagmites]. Wet [cardboard boxes] stacked along the [wall] contain empty unrecycled [liquor bottles]. The humid air smells of death.
[Nikolai's] office is an ill-maintained [balcony] sky box above his restaurant. A [window] looks out over the restaurant. But as you could see earlier, the [dining room] side is [mirrored] such that employees and guests can't see in. A rickety set of [steps] leads back to the main floor. The [plaster walls] are water stained and cracked. A single [unfrosted bulb] hangs from the [ceiling] by a [loose wire]. [Mounds of unpaid invoices] litter [Nikolai's] wooden [desk].
Windowless brick [walls] rise three stories on either side of you, blocking out most of the sunlight. The [cobbled] [alley] slopes down [hill] at a dangerous pitch. You won't be able to get back to the [street] from here however, as the top of the [alley] ends in a dead end, and the bottom is securely [gated], locked from the other side
You are walking past the [window] to [Goldschmidt's] [Pawnshop] (on the north side of 19th Street). Although the shop is closed right now, the [window] provides a neat [display of hocked merchandise]. Nikolai's Bar and Grill is east. To the west, the neighborhood becomes even seedier.
A grim little cul-de-sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of [narrow], twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the [real estate] agent's [office], which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A [narrow], garbage-choked [alley] opens to the southeast.
This [narrow] aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with [piles] of rotting [cardboard boxes and overstuffed] [garbage cans]. Ugly, half-[crumbling brick walls] to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a [tall, wooden fence].
Peering through the murk, you can make out the blocky outlines of [filing cabinets] lining the walls and a doorway to the west. A [window] high up on the south wall lets in a very faint illumination.
Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn [blinds]. The [office] is deserted, [papers] still scattered across the top of the [desk]. The front [door] lies west, and the file room lies east.
As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across [Whateley Bridge] toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.
To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the [top] of a steep rise, you can just make out the [vaulted] rooftops of the [university].
Isolated and serene within its high, [ivy]-covered walls, Miskaton [University] represents this benighted town's single, if somewhat dubious, claim to cultural achievement. Founded some time in the early 1800s, the [school's] reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.
Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted [ceiling], and small, [green-shaded desk lamps] cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in -- a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small [alcove] to the north [houses] the [circulation] [counter].
A hoary monument of [crumbling], moss-eaten flagstones, Whateley [Bridge] is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid [waters] of the [Miskaton River], connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the [water]. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking [stone parapets], but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.
A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep-roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The [municipal courthouse] stands at the south end of the square, next to the [mouth] of a [dark, narrow alley] to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies [Whateley Bridge].
A [low, irregular brick wall] to the north divides this [street] from the steep, mud-slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a [rusty] iron [gate] provides access to a precarious flight of stone [steps] leading down the bank to the [water's] edge. The [street] bends south here, turning into a misty [avenue] between the trees. The [town] square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.
The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest-northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the [Miskaton River] Valley and the grubby little [town] of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the [paper mill] almost directly to the north; the solitary [lighthouse] and surrounding [ocean] to the northeast; and the [dilapidated] [stone church] below you to the east. Winding through it all is the [oily] black [ribbon] of the [Miskaton], and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of [Town Square]. You can just make out the shape of the [obelisk] from here.
The [lane] runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving [driveway] runs up to the front [door] of your [house], which lies north.
Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The [doorways], leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the [stairs] leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.
A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the [stairs] down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the [stairs], is the master bedroom.
The master [bedroom] is a [picture]-postcard of rustic New England charm. [Faded sketches of rural landscapes] adorn the walls; a beautifully carved [dressing mirror] stands in one corner; an [old-fashioned] [accordion radiator] gurgles quietly beneath the [window]. The most striking feature, an [enormous, antique, four-poster] [bed], must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.
A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral-print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, [whitewashed], [claw-foot] [bathtub] with a [shower attachment], which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.
Much of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge [dining table] running the length of it is covered with a thick gray [film of dust], and the [china cupboard] standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. [Doorways] to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the [windows] in this place.
Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the [kitchen] walls are now merely ranks of dusty [cabinets] and a forest of empty hooks. [Doorways] lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the [back door] to the north leads out of the house.
The pantry is empty save for a layer of [dust] on the [shelves]. A [door] to the south leads down to the [cellar], or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.
The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome-smelling moisture, and the [sagging timbers] creak uneasily above your head. [Ancient, frayed wiring] festoons the [ceiling] like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the [stairs] to the north.
Old [crates and boxes] piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt-filled corners.
A long, oak-[paneled] room, with doorways to the south and west. [Paintings] line the walls, mounted beneath [small, shaded lamps] that would illuminate the [canvasses] nicely if only the electricity were working. Still, even in the shadowed gloom you can see that all were done by the same artist.
The east wall is occupied by a beautiful [antique sofa], and a large, [hand-woven] [rug] covers the hardwood floor. The huge [marble fireplace] in the north wall helps complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of the [fireplace] leads north.
The [shuttered] [window] at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare [wooden] floor. [Doorways] lead north and south.
Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. [Books] line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark-[paneled], green-carpeted room, interrupted only by [doorways] to the east and south. A rich, [brown leather armchair] sits in stately repose near the [window], with a [polished brass pipe stand] nearby completing the picture of some blue-blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.
This must be the [children's] [bedroom]. The [bed] is smaller than the one in the master [bedroom], its [bright coverlet] providing one of the few feeble splashes of color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan household. A small [vanity table] occupies the opposite wall, and in the corner under the [window] stands an ancient [crib]. The only exit is to the north.
A gravel path starts here at the [back door] of the [house], and marks a trail nearly overgrown by weeds and briars. It disappears into the undergrowth to the northwest, framed by crooked trees with overhanging branches that seem to form a stunted, jagged archway into the dim recesses of the forest.
Old, moss-slimed [tombstones], many broken off and leaning crazily like an old man's teeth, poke up from the soft, mulchy earth. In their midst stands an ancient marble [crypt], its heavy [iron door] nearly obscured by thick [draperies of ivy]. The trees press close around this quiet enclave of death, leaning together over your head as if sharing secrets. A gap in the undergrowth to the southeast reveals a narrow [gravel] path.
The air is clammy and frigid, the stone walls damp and [streaked] with mud and lichen. [Pale, swollen roots] push through cracks in the masonry. The smell of damp corruption is almost overpowering here, though the [stairs] to the south lead toward fresher air.
A long, dimly lit, north-south corridor stretches away from the courthouse entrance. Closed, [unmarked doors] line either side of the hall, their [pebbled glass windows] lit from within by a murky, yellow-orange light. Silence reigns here; your footsteps echo eerily on the tiled floor, and occasionally you can hear muted [conversation] behind one of the [doors] -- you can't tell which. At the hall's southern end, a [staircase] leads down into the basement; a sign hanging above it reads "RECORDS". You can return to Town Square to the north.
A single bulb dangling from the ceiling casts a watery, yellow light against the brick walls. A rickety [staircase] to the north leads back up to the ground floor, and two narrow doorways lead into the record archives. Over the southeast door hangs a sign that reads "BIRTH RECORDS", while the southwest door bears the sign "DEATH RECORDS".
A bare room with cinderblock walls. Thousands of [records and documents], most yellow and brittle with age, are stacked everywhere in towering [piles].
A high [counter] divides the public portion of the library from the reserved stacks -- all the more esoteric and mysterious volumes from the university's collection. If anything, the area behind the [counter] is even more shadowy than the side you're on. The main reading area lies south.
A dank, drafty [old drinking] hole lit by flickering, oil-burning [lanterns]. Smoke collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows [crowd] thick around. The [bar] runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway opens onto the street.
The lane narrows here to little more than a badly cobbled sidewalk as it wends its way up through a series of tortuous bends and switchbacks. In some places, the street is so steep that steps have been cut into it, worn down over the years and slick with moss. Your progress is blocked at the top of the street by a [blank brick wall].
You had no idea this little courtyard even existed, cleverly tucked away amidst the confusing tangle of darker avenues. Although surrounded on all sides by steep rooftops and overshadowed by the ever-ominous clouds, this secluded circle somehow manages to convey a sense of peace and brightness, a safe harbor from the oppressive gloom pervading the rest of the town. To the south, a [hanging sign] marks a [humble shop], while a sidestreet to the east leads back into the labyrinth.
A warm and pleasantly dim light surrounds you and suffuses this cozy little shop. The [shelves] are crammed with every conceivable variety of [new age curiosity]: [books, [crystals]], [pendants], [charms], [herbs, potions, incense, candles] and -- sure enough, on a [display] stand right near the door -- decorative cast-iron [cauldron]-shaped [paperweights]. How cute. In the rear of the store, a lit [display case] contains several items of interest. The courtyard lies outside, to the north.
Where once a building stood, there is now only cracked pavement and rampant weeds. A high [chain-link] [fence] surrounds this vacant lot; the only breaks lie to the west and southeast.
The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of [water] beneath the [wooden] pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the [sea]. The [fishing] industry (like the [paper] industry) has all but died away in Anchorhead; nonetheless there are still a few [boats] tied to the pier. A path leads back through an opening in a [chain-link] [fence] to the northwest; otherwise, it's just you and the [ocean].
This [smaller] room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is dusty and cluttered from having not been lived in for the better part of a year. Aside from the [desk] and the [chair] and the empty shelves, the only real feature of the room is the large, [ornate fireplace] in the southern wall.
It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to crawl, while to the north stands a [wooden door], draped in shadows and half-hidden by the slanting eaves.
A cramped little annex off the main attic, with a [tiny, shuttered] [window] high up on the north wall. A [pile of mouldering] [straw] in the corner and what looks like [pencil marks] on the lower part of the walls seem to indicate that someone lived here once. Or, possibly, was kept here.
The [walls] are [bare wooden slats, patched] with crumbling [plaster] and spiked with bent, rusted nails. The passage, no more than two feet wide at its widest point, bends and twist at confusing angles, making it hard to tell which direction you're heading in.
You are in a [small], enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through the dingy [skylight] over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls are covered with [astrological and astronomical] [charts] with [equations and diagrams] scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted [handwriting]. The only exit seems to be an oddly-[angled corridor] to the southeast.
The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the east the attic becomes more spacious, while the northwest corner opens into an oddly-[angled corridor].
This wing of the cellar is even [older] than the rest, with [walls] of piled, unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with [wine racks]. They cover every [wall] except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main cellar.
The passageway ends here at a fathomless [pit], a puckered circular [hole] in the rock from which the foul [wind] seems to emanate, howling up from the depths like a reeking banshee.
The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of wide [steps] carved into the living rock. The [stairs] continue down to the northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a narrow, oddly-[angled corridor] in the northwest corner.
The [stairs] end here at a [huge, greenish-gold door] set into the north wall. There is nothing else here; nowhere to go but onward or back.
The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with [mummified human corpses]. Shrunken and desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved [niches]. [Carvings] cover the rock walls in between the [niches] -- grotesque, leering [faces] too horrible even to look upon, their [features] twitching and smirking in the wavering [light] that sifts down from above.
The gently [winding] lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the oppressive [weather] and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the trees.
The [forest] grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the [road]. The groping, tangled [branches] block out what [little] sunlight there is left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering [leaves] and the slow drip of water are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching [trees], the shadows are impenetrably thick. The [road] stretches interminably, north to south.
The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside, vines torn down, and [small] trees bent or even snapped in half, as though something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.
The [decayed remains] of an [old slaughterhouse] stand here, now little more than a [shell] of crumbling [brick] and gaping [holes], surrounded by a clearing of yellow, sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a gaping [hole] that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting [building].
The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is nothing but bare, beaten [dirt]. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death -- a palpable, chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.
Beyond the south wall of the [old] slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north, where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a [hole] in the wall.
The sky is a dim circle of [light] far above you. The stone walls press in on you from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts up from the floor; the smell of a trapped [animal] decomposing under the back porch.
A low, [wrought-iron fence], its [spike-tipped] [bars] bent or leaning at crazy angles, surrounds the overgrown yard of this dark, [abandoned church]. A gap in the [fence] leads back west, while a bare path beaten through the groping weeds leads around the [church] to the southeast.
The forest encroaches right up to the [iron fence] here, some of which is literally buried in the tangled underbrush. There are no [doors] on this side, although a [wooden trap door] over by the corner of the [building] probably leads into a [cellar]. A path leads southwest, around to the front of the [church].
Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a [hulking shape] of black [metal] that was probably once a [wood-burning furnace]; aside from that, the [cellar] looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens in the west wall, and a [trap door] in the ceiling leads back up to the outside.
This alcove used to house a stairwell leading up and down; now it contains only a few rotted boards jutting from the walls and an [empty shaft] dropping down out of sight. Above you hang the broken-off remains of the [stairs] leading up to the [ground] floor, the [last] shattered [riser] only a couple of tantalizing feet out of reach.
The [stairs] stop short about seven feet shy of the basement floor, the [bottom]-most [steps] hanging suspended over an [empty shaft] that descends beyond sight into the shadowy depths. What's left of the [structure] creaks and shifts uneasily under your feet. At the top of the [stairs] to the north, a doorway opens onto the [ground] floor of the church.
A dim antechamber, opening onto the [main] chapel to the east. To the west, the [main doors] to the church have been solidly [nailed] shut, and through a shadowy doorway to the south you can see stairs leading down.
Broken shards from the shattered the [stained glass windows] grits under your feet as you step around rows of [overturned] [pews]. The dust and cobwebs have been busy here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies the vestibule; to the east, a [small] doorway behind the [pulpit] leads to the back of the church.
This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A [ladder] bolted to the wall leads up through a hatch, presumably up into the steeple.
A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across, the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head. There is a [narrow window], but it seems to have been [painted] [black] at some point. The only exit seems to be the [ladder] from which you just emerged.
Your feet dangle over [empty] space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint glimmer of water, far below.
The tunnel is ankle-deep in [brackish water], though raised walkways on either side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air [damp and foul]. The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous [smaller] [pipelines] lead in all directions, but all are too [small] for you to crawl through. [Iron rungs] embedded in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.
The ceiling in this north-south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to navigate it. [Water] drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip-plip-plipping echoing loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River -- underneath it.
This looks to be an [older] part of the [sewer] system that has fallen into disrepair. Many of the [pipes] here have crumbled and are filled with debris.
Much of the [water] is pouring through an open [hatch] set in the floor of the tunnel.
This narrow strip of [beach] is tucked away between two [outcroppings] in the predominantly [rocky] shoreline, accessible only from a [steep], muddy slope to the west. The [sand] is filthy and strewn with [rocks, [seaweed]], [litter] and other bits of storm-tossed [detritus].
The road carries you across a desolate [heath of gray, windswept] [grass]. To the south, the black, [jagged] outline of [Anchorhead's] steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the [railroad tracks] in one direction, out toward the [seashore] in the other.
The [road] turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front [entrance] to the [old paper mill]. A [gate of heavy iron bars] blocks the only opening into this charred [fortress], although an overgrown path leads around the [wall] to the south. To the north, a rutted [lane] threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.
The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven [rows] of decrepit, clapboard [shacks]. The [town] is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the [wind] betray the overall stillness.
A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working-class poverty. The floor is warped and [broken] wood, bare dirt showing through the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the [window] in lieu of curtains. Over in the far corner is a [rickety old stove]; in the opposite corner a [threadbare] [cot]; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all in this single room, which is slightly [smaller] than your bedroom back at the house.
The [foundations] of an [older] structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill [wall]. Weeds push up through cracked and buckling [slabs of concrete]; [twisted rebar and rusting] [pipes] poke up like the legs of dead insects. The [ruins] are surrounded on all sides by dense [thickets], although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast through the [underbrush].
The north end of the access crawlway ends at a [sturdy metal hatch]. A thick haze of steam hangs in the air, and the heat is like an oven -- the walls and floor are almost blistering to the touch.
Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous [vats, presses] and sundry [machinery], the ever-churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging [machinery]. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.
The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the [machines] beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what looks like a wide [balcony] with several large [banks of equipment].
Several [workbenches and racks of arcane electronic] [equipment] have been dragged together to form a sort of open laboratory on this [wide] balcony overlooking the mill. A [wide table] dominates the area, strewn with [precision tools], bits of wire, and [scribbled calculations]. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the mill floor, and a [metal ladder] leads down into the [machinery] below.
You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone [tower] of Anchorhead's [lighthouse] stands vigil against the [ocean].
You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the [sea]. Before you looms the ancient, [massive lighthouse], a vertiginous [pillar] of pale [brick] jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.
The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and [heavy]. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary [old] whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete [steps] lead up.
The [stairs] give onto a wide, [circular] chamber surrounded by [windows]. The [glass] is [old] and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the magnificence of the [view]. In one direction, the [dying heath] and the stunted cluster of buildings that is [Anchorhead]; in the other, the [ocean] like a vast, undulating blanket.
You are in a padded [cell], the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete covered with [thick, quilted padding]. The [door] in the west wall is also covered with [padding], except for a [tiny observation] [window] about five feet up, from which a feeble light trickles in.
A grim hallway of concrete and [industrial] [green tiles]. This is the north end; the hallway runs south from here. [Doors] lead east and west, and a narrow, [barred window] to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.
A grim hallway of concrete and [industrial] [green tiles], running north and south from here. [Doors] lead east and west.
This is the south end; the hall runs north from here. [Doors] lead east and west, and a [doorway] to the south leads to the top of a stairway.
Another padded [cell], much like the rest. There is a [door] in the east wall.
The hallway runs south from here; to the north, the hallway ends at the [barred gate] leading to the lobby.
Ugly, mint-[green tiles] and walls of whitewashed cinderblock comprise the decor of this inhospitable waiting room. A [hard little sofa] upholstered in [avocado vinyl] and a feebly struggling [potted palm] are provided for the comfort of visitors, although you get the feeling that few inmates of this institution are fortunate enough to have visitors. A metal [gate bars] entrance to a southern [passageway], which you assume leads to the inmates' section.
The [grim, white-washed] [edifice of Danvers Asylum] bounds this tiny, shadowed courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred [windows] staring blankly down at you like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.
The rooftops above you lean so close together as to nearly block out the [sky] altogether, making this a particularly dark and unpleasant section of the city. The street leads away to the east, and a shadowy driveway leads through a high brick wall to the south.
The [island] is barely forty feet across, its [surface] covered with an ankle-[deep] layer of [slime and muck]. Underneath the [muck], the [ground] throbs -- heaving [rhythmically] to a blasphemous, living [pulse].
A [small] outcropping of stone, just [large] enough for you to stand on, sticks out from the end of the breakwater. The hungry [sea] laps at your feet, surging over the rocks and then trickling down into crevices. To the southwest, an uneven trail leads [back] up the rocks, around the side of the [lighthouse].
You are home, and it is a momentous event. [Downstairs], Michael is waiting for you to bring [him] the wondrous news. To the east is the bedroom you both share, and to the north is your bathroom.
Rain and [muddy] [water] are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. [Sodden earth and mud] surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of [lightning] illuminate a [storm] tossed [sky].
Dozens of [stone markers] stand here, oblivious to the [wind] and the [rain]. Huge, [twisted [oaks]], their [limbs] tossed by the [wind], draw an unmentionable sustenance from the [moss]-covered, [moldy] [ground]. An odor of decay, which even the [storm] cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the [graveyard], an [ivy]-covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.
This side of the [church] is untended and [grasses and weeds] have run rampant. A [muddy] [trail] leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a [faint path] continues around the [church] to the northeast.
Two [massive oak trees] which flank the cracked [sidewalk] dominate the front of the [church]. The facade of the [church] itself rises beyond them, its [steeple] silhouetted against the [sky]. The [storm] lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the [storm] is trying to wash the [church] clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a [sidewalk] leads to the front of the [church]. A [weed]-choked [driveway] runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a [muddy path] leads around the [church] to the northwest.
This [wide, covered porch] spans the width of the church front. A [white picket railing] surrounds the [porch] on three sides, except to the south where a short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk. Two large [windows] have been [boarded] up but the main doors stand slightly ajar.
This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were probably once [stained glass windows] are shattered and [boarded] up. [Dirt and debris] covers the floor. A set of double [doors] leads south back to the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary. Overhead, there is an open [trap door] in the [ceiling] at about twice your height.
Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty. [Debris] is scattered among the [sagging pews] and only shards of [broken glass] remain of the [stained glass windows]. Most of the interior fixtures have been removed, but a large [portrait of Christ] stares down at you from above the archway to the south. The [pulpit] still stands to the north.
From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church. The [pulpit] is empty except for the [podium] which rises from the center. A small door is visible behind the [podium] to the north.
This small office has the same run-down appearance of the rest of the church. [Debris] covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around the boards covering a [broken] window. A [desk] stands in the middle of the room and an empty [bookshelf] sits against one [wall]. A [pile of ashes] marks where a [fire] once burned in the middle of the floor. A door to the south [leads] back to the sanctuary.
This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap [door] in the floor.
The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are [hanging] from a maze of [support beams and trusses] with the nearest solid floor far below you. [Large] open frames give a view of the surrounding [forest] and of the [town] at the [base] of the [hill]. They also allow the fury of the [storm] to pass in unimpeded. You can see the [branch] of an [oak tree] just outside the southern frame.
The [limbs] of the [tree] are swaying violently from the [storm], but near the trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from here of the [church grounds] and surrounding area. The [church] seems to be in a clearing on a [hill] surrounded by a [forest]. At the [base] of the [hill] a small [town] can be seen, its [lights] glimmering faintly through the [storm].
Even with the [door] open and the wind from the storm blowing in this room is rank with a fetid odor. The floor is piled high with [trash] and half eaten scraps of food. There are no windows, only the [broken door] frame to the south. An [old sofa] is pushed against one [wall] and a [heavy table] sits in the middle of the room. A [curtained archway] is to the north.
Until quite recently, someone lived here, you feel sure. Now the [furniture] is matchwood and the windows are glassless. Outside, it is a warm, sunny day, and grasslands extend to the low hills on the horizon.
There is a [chestnut horse] here, munching on a pile of oats.
A [heavy iron door] bars the cave mouth.
This is a crowded, noisy bazaar. Directly in front of you is a [lottery]! But the contemptuous-looking [barker] is doing a very poor trade: hardly anyone wants his first prize, the big [cuddly] toy [elephant], or even his nineteenth prize, a [featureless] white [cube].
This seems to be the inside of a featureless white [cube], forty feet on a side. The air is stale and there is no exit.
The big [top] can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.
This area of matted-down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big [top] entrance to the north and the enticements of the [midway] to the east, where a sagging [banner] hangs crookedly above a [turnstile]. There is a [drinking] [fountain] near the side [wall] of the [tent]. You can enter the night to the west and south.
You're standing next to the big [top], which is gently flapping in the warm breeze.
You're standing in front of the [turnstile] [entrance] to a [fenced]-in area, which is south. To the west stands a droopy [tent], and the [field] continues north and east.
This dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous [props] and wacky devices, including a midget [automobile] that's garaged in here.
You are standing on a gentle upslope of the grassy [field], next to a rather imposing [trailer] whose [door] is closed to the east. In [dark] panorama, the [field] continues north and west -- and south, where a large [banner] has been erected.
This is the [arena's] oval-shaped performance [ring] which appears deathly quiet without its circus atmosphere. Also missing is its safety net. A [rope] ladder dangles to within a foot of the ground.
You're standing on a small, unstable [platform] which is suspended high above the [arena] floor by guy [wires] converging on it from all [directions]. A [rope] ladder dangles from the [platform] and the [tightrope] stretches east to the opposite [platform].
You are standing, poised high above the [arena] floor, a couple of baby steps across the [tightrope].
The [tightrope] stretches west to the opposite [platform].
You're in the east end of the performers' [camp]. It is unevenly lighted by a number of glaring [spotlights] which ring the [camp], creating a stage-like patchwork of light and [dark].
You're in the west end of the performers' [camp].
The gut of the [trailer] exposes the underside of circus life -- grungy [costumes] strewn about, crooked and cracked [mirrors], the musty odor of fresh makeup mingled with [clown] sweat infusing the [air].
You're [standing] between the underside of the grandstand and the side [wall] of the big [top]. Not unexpectedly, the ground here is strewn with [garbage]. The only exit is southwest.
To the west is the [turnstile] exit from the [midway], which continues east. The side of the big [top] borders on the north. A soiled, sagging [banner] beckons south.
This scrawny patch of dirt offers a square cage on its west side; an open tent giving off a dank, earthy smell on its east side; and a well-worn path along the tent to the southeast. A soiled, sagging [banner] beckons north.
You are standing outside of the elephant tent. Along its side wall to the north sits a [cage] with straw poking out of it. The menagerie is northwest of here.
This [barred] rectangular hovel is blanketed with straw and has the look, if not the smell, of a human dwelling. Its southside [door] stands open.
This is about [midway] along the [midway]. Your eyes soak in the lavishly painted sideshow [fronts -- Andrew Jenny's] to the south and [Rimshaw's] to the north.
You've reached the far end of the [midway]. A sideshow front to the north advertises the "827 Pounds of Feminine Charm" that is [Tina].
Dominating this once spacious [room], geographic in her enormity, mountainous in her irreducibility, the fat [lady] sits (though no chair is visible) breathtakingly to the east. Paths around the attraction lead northeast and southeast.
The fat [lady] sits (though no chair is visible) breathtakingly to the west. Paths around the attraction lead northwest and southwest.
Here inside the round [cage] you [stand] in a dingy indoor twilight, surrounded by a panorama of closely spaced [bars]. The [cage door] that you're still keeping an eye on is to the east.
This is a cozy little drawing [room] where guests are received. On the gloomy west side of the [room], a spiral [staircase] leads upward.
The [parlor], with its tufted black leather [sofa], softly [lighted] [chandelier and darkly] varnished paneling strives for a subdued turn-of-the-century motif and is purposefully dimmed -- thus setting the mood for conveyance, for squinting.
You're in the "blues," sitting high above the [arena] floor. You know the exit from the grandstand to be vaguely eastward and down. All around you the [crowd] is in a state of pandemonium.
You're standing in semidarkness on top of a [cage] next to the elephant [tent] which rises above. You can see, faintly, a rope [ladder] hanging from the top edge of the [tent].
You are standing unsteadily on top of a gabled [tent]. On one edge of the [tent] a rope [ladder] drops down.
You stand on the [straw]-covered [cage] floor, surrounded on four sides by closely spaced iron [bars]. The open [cage door] is east.
You are on the [wagon], a condition in which you're not likely to find the detective. The aluminum [roofing] gives way slightly underfoot. You observe a square aluminum [panel], and next to it, a kind of [crank].
This is Mr. [Munrab's] plush inner sanctum, containing all the furnishings of the well-appointed, modern [office] -- including a shiny, expansive cherry-hardwood [desk]. Along one [wall], below some framed [sheepskin], runs a [shelf of books].
In the far [corner] of this tented enclosure a thick, undulating [cloud of smoke] hovers over a [poker game]. Straight across from you a tight-jawed [dealer] stands over a [blackjack] [table] covered with a green floor-length [tablecloth].
You are standing amid a kaleidoscope of his-and-her garments, a view as if from inside a clothes drier in mid-cycle. Among the mentionables are a sequin-[dress]/safari-[suit combination], and a knitted-[shawl]/leather-[jacket combo].
These quarters are furnished in a foreigner's vision of American Rugged Individualism. The [head] of a moose, for example, hangs as a [trophy] against one wall. Against the west wall the [door] stands open and a gaily [decorated] [curtain] is open at the window.
This is the [arena's] oval-shaped performance [ring]. The [rope ladder] above your [head] has been tangled around the platform from which it hangs.
The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these [teachests] are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light.
Scruffy old [furniture] is piled up here: armchairs with springs coming out, umbrella stands, a badly [scratched cupboard], a table with one leg missing... You try to remember why you keep all this rubbish, and fail. Anyway the attic continues to the southeast.
This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made [calendar] of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.
A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous [pile] of tie-dyed [sheets], from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October.
A disused storage room off the winery. In one [wall] is an opening onto an ominous [dark shaft], and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style [wheel] with a [handle] on.
This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft [insulation] [rolls], left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark.
This is a roughly-furnished [photographer's] dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them.
Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted [books] kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a [water] tank and some [pipes] in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.
Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one [wall] onto a [dark shaft], and a big Victorian-steam-engine style [wheel] beside it with a [handle] on. The cellar continues east-to-west and south.
The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a [hole] about ten or eleven inches across in the west [wall]. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you.
In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you dare not be seen from the windows by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens, or else east along a path hugging the [wall].
A tourist river-boat, glass-roofed. You can climb out to the shore to the east. At the helm is a very strange [man], at times almost a straw dummy, almost perhaps a [hollow] cut-out made of paper. He (or it) turns the wheel and casts his eyes to windward.
You stand in the shade of a great [plane tree], seedlings for which were brought back from Spain by an ancestor of yours in 1806. To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew Hall Maze. A signpost reading "To the Mosaic" points east across the lawn.
A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by [walls] and the privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the [wall] makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden.
A modest brick garage, built into the [garden walls]. A big open doorway leads east onto the clearing.
Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the [garden] least visible from the house.
This flagstoned rampart on the hillside looks across the valley, down (unfortunately) to the [motorway] below. Coaches pass by, reminding you of the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a [plaque].
The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but [Meldrew] Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.
Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all! It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one [wall] and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney.
This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A [slide projector] is aimed at the whitewashed south [wall], one of the outside [walls] of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory.
This basement room is filled with crate after crate of [glasses and cups], enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost [anything] might be hidden among them. A [little] light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only [door] is shut tight.
There is a storm tossing the deck, one which drives no rain: you reel from one side to the other, hanging onto the rail, grabbing at the [mast] or the [rigging]. Nobody else seems to be aboard. The boat makes no headway in a strange, glassy mist.
A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's [windows], offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north.
A broad, dark octagonal room devoted to dull exhibits of the disastrous Nile Valley Expedition of '21 - the few good ones were donated to the British Museum. A back staircase leads west to the unbuilt extension, while the entrance seems to be the cobwebbed passage southeast. High [windows] on the northern face let in dim light.
Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a [doorway] to the west. A [bed] is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep.
Inside one quarter of the cramped [revolving door], which is blocked off from the world outside and opens only onto the foyer, southwest.
An annexe to the museum, containing sundry archaelogical finds, badly labelled in German (which you can hardly read at the best of times) and securely pinioned inside [glass cabinets]. The storm outside thrashes against the narrow dark windows.
An old administrative office of the museum, emptied and made into a prison [cell]: amateur but effective.
This shambolic flat, extending to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. [Peeling]-away [posters] have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent.
The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense [sticks] and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging [bead] curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric [bell push] and a [wicked Tarot pack].
This is an old stone patio in the heart of the [garden] maze. A missing flagstone offers an intriguing dark prospect beneath.
A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly [lit] and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west.
You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, there is only a black [metal] one-metre cube with an unimpressive collection of [gauges and dials]. An aluminium staircase leads up.
The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a [contraption] fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass [wall] which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.
A long clifftop walk by the sea, from the lighthouse to the west to the village not far east. These fields are occupied by [herds] of hardy mountain [goats], continually butting each other and frisking. To the south a path leads across sparse grassland to a great outgrowth of some kind.
The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, [wall of thorns], which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north.
The beautiful candle-[lit] Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along.
The fabled Labyrinth seems only to consist of a broad cross. Arms run to northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest, while a flight of [stone] steps widens and climbs south.
A dry cave opening from a crack to the northeast, becoming a fair-sized cavern, furnished with [bronze and lit] by trestle lamps chained from the ceiling.
One of the most beautiful hedge-enclosed, tree-muffled lawns in England, and just out of sight of the house, this has been a jewel in the gardens for centuries. Since the twenties it has also been a croquet lawn, of the regulation twenty-four yards square, laid out with a central coloured [peg] and six peripheral [hoops].
A warm winter's night in the [ancient] city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is [lit] up with [torches]: it is a night of celebration.
A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is [ancient]. Most of the [little] termite-hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.
Ransacked, dimly-[lit], cramped and empty, this rough-built and uneven burial mound is to the Great Pyramids of Giza (built just a century before) what the summerhouse in your garden is to Windsor Castle. There are only dull [painted writings], an unpleasant odour and a passage out to the north.
The main southwest-northeast road forks off with a road due north to the Theatre. Despite the kaleidoscopic din you are impressed by the sober majesty of the Museum of the Ptolemies, whose fine [portico entrance], decked with [reliefs], is southeast.
This small, dark (by night) room is a repository for Library supplies: above all, for [lamp oil], which is stored in broad [shallow] earthenware [troughs]. Lucky your torch is electric, when you think about it. Anyway, a passage leads back north.
The celebrated Library of Alexandria, finest in the entire world, possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the ancient [poems] - hence the nickname.
A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with inset shelves on which are [scrolls] beyond count, ribboned, [dusty], disintegrating, badly catalogued so that only an [expert] can find what he wants.
A tiny office adjoining the colonnades north, this is home to [Apollonius] the [head Librarian], whose writing implements, table and sand-wells are scattered untidily about.
Down by the sea-front, in the [old] harbourlands, surrounded by warehouses. The Mediterranean laps darkly against the hard, splashing an occasional wave up the slope. The city, and the party, lie back east.
The passage, descending from the east down to the west, is cut from [marble], lined with painted scenes from the fashionable comedies of Menander, decorated with Alexandrian coloured glass ornaments.
A doorway with a [hanging bead curtain] leads east. In the centre of the room is a [table], which is [bare].
(You are so distracted that common sense takes over and you clamber out of the [mummy case].)
Well, perhaps "sarcophagus" is a [little] melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. This must be somewhere under the old parish church. You are stooped over inside a [stone tomb], stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place.
This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time-worn [Roman mosaic], divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised [Roman] life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.
The magnificent balcony overlooking the Royal harbour of Alexandria. In two hundred years' time, Julius Caesar will be besieged here, and will hold the palace with a tiny force of men against an entire army: and will lose his [heart] to Cleopatra...
There is a beautiful view over the green parceled farmlands and hills surrounding the village, and you feel a certain pride to see Meldrew Hall sitting amongst it. It's also windy and dangerous up here on the grey lead spire of the parish church, beside the [old clock]: fortunately an opening leads down into the clerestory.
The [bell]-ringing chamber, half-way up the church tower. Thick [braided ropes] hang down, tailing into [sashes]. A [plaque] on one wall announces that in 1901, ten men (Roger Meldrew among them) rang a Kent Triple Bob.
Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of [stone], filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.
An alcove in the [ancient] west side of the church, beneath stained glass windows of the Resurrection.
Beside the long triangle of the [green], under the [stone cross] of the First World [War memorial]. The [public] footpath runs south to a stile. The village is tiny: the [parish church], the "[Goat and Compasses]" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few [houses] and desultory tea-shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.
An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an [iron] doorway and the warmth of the house.
You half-stand, half-float in a [golden], misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight [lattice of oblong crystals], bathed in warm pearly light.
An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened [rope hanging] down into the darkness.
You are hanging perilously on a [hemp rope], suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly.
The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman [mosaic], quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is [lit] by moonlight.
Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are [little] more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent.
This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are [lit] and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.
You're in your [room] in the [Red] Boar Inn. It's sparsely furnished, but comfortable enough. To the north is the [door], and there's a [closet] without a [door] to the west. On the floor is a [note] that must have been slipped under the [door] while you slept. In a corner of the [room] is a lopsided wooden [dresser].
A comfortable [bed] sits along the wall.
You are at the top of the [stairs] in the [Red] Boar. Your [room] is to the south, and other [rooms] line the hall. The lighting in the hallway is dim and drab like the [wallpaper and carpeting].
A [desk clerk] sits behind the [counter]. The [Weasel] heads off to the south.
This is the end of the Wharf Road, an east/west, two-lane road that's the island's main street. Off to the east, small businesses line the south side of the street. A winding road starts to the southwest, heading toward the [lighthouse]. The [Red] Boar Inn is to the south. Your throat starts to feel dry.
You are on the Wharf Road, with the McGinty Salvage office to the south. The [ocean] lies to the north, its brine smell strong and refreshing.
You are on the Wharf Road where the wharf starts up to the north. The former site of Outfitters International's warehouse fronts the south side of the road. To the west the [Weasel] comes into view from the south.
The east/west Wharf Road continues, with Outfitters International, a store which supplies [ocean]-going vessels, to the south. The [Weasel] is to the west, heading toward the east.
You're on the east end of Wharf Road. The [Ocean] Road starts here and parallels the island's east edge, heading to the southeast. The Shanty is to the south.
This is The Shanty, a tavern which serves the locals. A wooden [bar] travels the length of the place, and behind it is a [mirror] so dirty, it offers no reflection. Round [tables] occupy the floor. The smell of [cooking] food permeates the place. A [bartender] behind the [bar] polishes [glasses] with a worn towel. A [parrot] with an [eyepatch] hobbles up and down the [bar]. Pete the [Rat] fiddles with his [eyepatch], shifting his weight from foot to foot. [Johnny Red] is here, chatting with the [bartender]. "Sit down and we'll talk," [Johnny Red] says.
You are in an east/west alley. To the north is a vacant lot, and an overgrown [field] lies to the south.
You are in a narrow alley. To the north is the back [door] of McGinty Salvage, as well as a small [window]. An overgrown [field] lies to the south.
You're at the west end of an east/west alley. The back entrance to the [Red] Boar Inn is to the north, and an overgrown [field] is to the south.
You are in an alley behind Outfitters International. An abandoned [field] lies to the south.
You're at the east end of an east/west alley. The back [door] of The Shanty is to the north, and an overgrown [field] is to the south. Narrow paths to the northeast and southeast lead to the Ocean Road.
You are at the north end of the [Ocean] Road, a narrow north/south road on the east edge of the island. The Wharf Road starts to the northwest, and a back alley starts off to the southwest.
You are halfway along the [Ocean] Road, with the start of an alley off to the northwest. An empty [field] lies to your west, and the dangerous [ocean] shore lies off to your east.
This is the south end of the [Ocean] Road. To the southeast is a small path leading up to about 100 feet above [sea] level. The [Ocean] Road heads north, and the Shore Road starts to the southwest.
This is the east end of the Shore Road, an east/west road with a ferry landing at its west end. The Mariners' [Trust], the island's only [bank], is off to the north. The [Ocean] Road starts up to the northeast.
You are at the west end of the east/west Shore Road, with the ferry landing to the west. To the north is an impenetrable [field], while the south is bordered by the [ocean]. You can see the mainland in the distance.
The ferry to the mainland arrives here every two hours during the [day]. [People] are milling about. The Shore Road starts off to the east.
A winding road starts up here to the southwest. You can see the top of the [lighthouse] off to the northwest. The Wharf Road lies to the northeast.
The road branches to the northeast and northwest with the [lighthouse] off to the northwest. To the south is an impenetrable swamp. Pete the [Rat] is off to the northwest. The [Weasel] is off to the northwest. [Johnny Red] is off to the northwest.
The road ends at the [lighthouse] to the north, and heads back to the southeast. You can see and hear the [ocean] pound the shoreline.
The [Weasel] is picking his teeth with a nasty [knife], looking around furtively. [Johnny Red] is here. 
"We're not sure which wreck to salvage," [Johnny] says. "Since you're joining up, we're hoping you'll identify where the dinner [plate] came from, and then do the dive for us. I'll captain, Pete will [cook], and the [Weasel] will crew.
You are in the [McGinty] Salvage office, a concern whose main business is salvaging wrecks. The place is a mess, and the floor is littered with chewed-on [cigar stubs]. To the north lies the Wharf Road. You can't help feeling uncomfortable here. [McGinty] is here, smoking his [cigar].
This is Outfitters International, a store that specializes in marine supplies. There is a long, high [counter] separating the supplies and the front area. To the north is the Wharf Road. A [salesman] stands behind the [counter]. There is a price [list] here. [Johnny] [Red] appears, striding like a proud lion.
You are at Point Lookout, a small, high cliff that affords a spectacular view of the [sea]. The cliff bottom is dangerous, so the only safe path is the northwest footpath back to the [Ocean] Road.
Pete the [Rat] heads off to the west.
Pete the [Rat] is [watching] over his [stew].
You are in the wheelhouse of the Night [Wind]. The passageway leading out onto the deck lies abaft. Through the glass [windows] you see the Mary [Margaret] docked at the wharf, and the island stretching aft. Forward, you see the choppy [waters] of the bay.
You are on the port side of the Night [Wind]. The wheelhouse is to starboard. The teak deck is very well-kept. The [ocean] lies off to port.
You are at the fore end of the Night [Wind]. You can see the [ocean] over the [rail] that runs around the deck. A [ladder] leads below deck, and the wheelhouse is aft of you. A [chair] is [bolted] to the deck.
You are in a tiny, smelly space where it is difficult to breathe. By your feet lie the diesel [engines] of the Night [Wind].
You are at the bow of a steel [ship] that has been here for quite a while. The deck continues aft, and there is a passage leading down at your feet.
This [cabin] seems to have been [sleeping] quarters. It must have been used by the crew, as it is spartanly furnished. The only ways out of this [room] are up and down.
This [cabin] is the third-class passengers' quarters. There couldn't have been many frills here since the remains are spartan. The [cabin] can be exited aft and up.
This was once the supplies locker, with exits forward and up, and a [door] with a [sign] on it in the aft [bulkhead].
A number of spherical [mines] with [spikes] sticking out of them litter the [room]. These [mines] must have once been used to blockade [shipping] lanes. Most of them are tethered together on the deck, but one is floating up near the [hole] in the [ceiling].
This former dining [room] has some [tables] upturned and scattered about, a [door] forward, a [hole] through the floor, and a narrow opening abaft.
The settling of debris has left a very narrow passage through this [cabin]. You can go forward or aft.
This [cabin] was once a passenger compartment, although the fragile [partitions] within have collapsed. The [room] is filled with air and a glance tells you why: the closed [door] to aft kept the air and [water] pressures equalized, stopping the flow of [water] up through the [hole] in the deck.
This is a rather dark and small room, having only two exits, back north the way you came, from the ancestral homes of Tana, or through the heavily barred [wooden door] before you that leads southwest and inward to the abandoned Deephome, abode of the Dwarves in Telleen. It has been three hundred years since your people lived here.
This guard post is [small] and inconspicuous, but positioned so that no one unwanted takes advantage of the secret entrance to the northeast, which is disguised as a common [fireplace]. On the northwest wall is a [cabinet]. To the southwest is a [small door] that leads out to the Main Hall and there is a [tiny table] in the middle of the room.
The main hall is quite large, and is lit by [magical torches] that line the walls all around, in a pattern that spirals up the grandiose room. [Elevators] hang in mid air, no longer powered. To the northeast is a small opening that is usually covered over by a tapestry that has long since been removed, to the northwest is a [staircase] leading up to one of the villages where your people lived; to the west you see the railway station. A main street runs to the south.
This was once a bustling trading center with [shops] lining the sides of the streets, and smaller, less affluent merchants' [booths] sitting outside of the doorways, offering items of lower quality at a substantially lower rate. At this particular point in the street you see a clothier to the northeast, a bakery to the east, and a scrivener's  to the west. To the north is the Main hall, and the street runs further south.
This section of the Main street is dedicated to quieter pursuits. To the east is the [Library], and to the west is the [Great Temple]. Main Street runs north and south from here.
Here meet the two major roads of the city proper:  Main Street, which runs north and south, and the Royal road which runs west from here. To the east is a guard [post] with a [sign] next to it.
These mines branch off into different directions with [signs] above each, indicating which kind of ore vein the mine follows. They are all shut down except for the first few yards of the gold mine. To the north is the mining center.
The [coal] mines are rather stark, for by the time the Dwarves moved into Deephome, they had already developed the technology to use the world's core for energy, what they called Geothermal power. The [rock] on the [wall] looks like it has been dug in some, however. The mine opens up to the mining center to the west.
Here is a large wonder of technology and ingenuity. The [generator] runs on the natural heat of the world, having pipes that lead all the way to near the core of the world. However, it requires a small fire to start the process of activating the power. The [generator] itself is large and black, having a small [furnace] in the very front. A doorway leads to the west, out into the street.
Here hangs, from thick [cables], the major means of transportation over the great chasms that separate the locals of the city. From here you can reach the Smithy Court, the Soldiers' Court, and the Treasury. You can hear the hum of the motor in the [car]. To the east is the Main Hall.
Here you see a heavy [forge] and a few [scrap] pieces of [iron and steel] lying on the floor. An [anvil] sits in the middle of the room, and next to it is a [small barrel] that at one time held water and a [large] one that held [oil].
There is almost nothing in this room, only a small [furnace] and equally small [anvil]. The floor is clear of any refuse, and it seems that the smith who left his shop took the time to clean it.
Wood is rarely used in the kingdoms of the Dwarves, mostly because it does not grow underground. So, few dwarves ever become carpenters. However, by law, there must be at least one carpenter in each city at each time. Though their jobs are few, the carpenters usually make a fair amount of money on the projects that they are hired for. This shop, and its fancy [furnishings], tells no different story.
This symbolic [forge] is the result of the nearly catastrophic Wares Wars in which the smiths of different trades first competed for excellence, and then actually took the lives of artisans who were beating them, so that they would not lose profit. It was finally decided that a [common forge] would be established in all Smithy Courts where artisans could gather and peacefully exchange secrets and tricks of their trades. To the south is the Smithy Court.
Here is a [deep, dark pit], that all of the [slag] is thrown into. It is forbidden by law to throw anything at all into such a [pit] except [slag]. The Smithy Court is to the southwest.
This shop is quite fancy, with intricate [etching] on the door-posts and a [shiny mirror] on the back wall, which must have been meticulously cleaned every day to keep the dirt and grime and smoke from dimming its brilliance. The forge itself, however, is not to be found. To the west is the Smithy Court.
Scores of plain [mounds] stand before you, all with closed and locked doors. Inside each one will be accommodations for twenty dwarves. However, as is customary, they can not be entered until a sufficiently ranked officer is present. To the east is the Railway Station, the Armory lies to the west, the mess hall is to the south, and the training grounds are to the southwest.
This vast cavern is a patchwork of different fields for [training] soldiers. There are [archery ranges] and several different sized [mounds]. To the northeast are the barracks, and to the southwest can be heard the sound of rushing water.
[Water] plummets nearly a hundred feet, crashing on the rocks below, into a [flowing river], and slowly smoothing the entire landscape. The old access ladders that reach the top of the [waterfall] are gone, swept away, but a large [intake pipe] is here, pulled away from the [water].
The [armory] is stocked with many different kinds of [weapons] from [swords and axes] to [bows and slings]. There are also [suits of armor] here on racks. The [armory] doorway leads east to the barracks.
Long [tables of stone] sit on the open floor here, and a substantial [kitchen] forms a U shape around the eating area. Nearly a thousand Dwarves could probably eat here at once. To the north are the barracks.
The Library is quite large: floor after floor of [books] rises before you, clinging to the walls of this circular room. [Stairs] lead up the middle, spiraling along and pausing at landings at each floor. At the very center of the building you can look straight up and see the [roof], and on it a [mural].
This road is quite beautiful, decorated on its sides with fluorescent [mosses] that feed on the minerals in the stones that line the sides of the roads. Somehow, the [mosses] do not leave their designated stones. High walls on both sides make the street feel more like a hall than an open passageway, and gates leading to palaces break up the monotony of the stone. A single gate is open to the north. The road continues east and to the west is the outer court of the Lord's Palace.
This room is filled with [scores and scores of pipes], leading this way and that, all connecting with the walls at one point or another. A large [wheel] sticks out of a rather [significant] pipe and there is a [sign] above it. To the northeast is the main road.
This is the most fortified of the guard posts, for it protects the entrance to the Dwarven City of Deephome. There are several [weapons] [racks] in this rather interesting room, including one that obviously hung crossbows. The layout is like an hourglass, with the walls closing in on the center of the room, and [two heavy iron banded doors] hanging there, ready to be closed if attackers should come. In the outer wide area that leads to the gates of the city, there are several low walls designed to function as defensive points should enemies enter in here. To the west is an intersection. The actual city gates are to the southeast.
The city [gates] stand closed, allowing some sunlight to filter into the immediate room. The [doors] are always closed when a city is abandoned, so that interlopers do not come in and desecrate the holy places. A [heavy chain] connected to a series of [gears] and a [control panel] are used to open the gate which lies to the south. The guard post stands defensively to the northwest.
Tall pine trees stand all about, somewhat obscuring the large cave entrance into Deephome. After three hundred years the original main road has grown over quite a bit. There is a [signpost] here and a road leading west and south. The cave's entrance leads north.
[Trees] stand along the sides of this road, their branches hanging low above the hard packed [dirt]. [Acorns] are sparsely scattered in the grass among the leaves. One rather [large tree] is here, with very low hanging branches.
This tool shop is quite unique in your travels in that it actually is functional. A young and somewhat intelligent looking [human] is standing behind the counter, reading a [thick book]. The walls are covered with all kinds of [tools] from [hammers] to [saws] to [wrenches] and claws. The doorway leads east to the town square.
This shallow [pond] is surrounded by tall [trees] that shade the entire area. Lily-pads float atop the still [water], allowing small [creatures] to hop from one side of the [pond] to another. Thick [rushes] grown up on the southern side of the [pond], where it looks like a small [stream] leads into the [water]. It is unusually quiet here.
You come upon a [small] clearing with a [patch of clover] growing in the middle. A [large tree] grows up right in the middle of the clearing, and a [small brook] encircles the [tree]. A [sign] stands in the clearing also.
This room has many [portraits] hanging on the walls, all of the [treasurers] of Deephome from its very founding a millennium and a half ago. To the west is a large steel [vault door] and to the north is the bank used by the common people of Deephome. To the northeast is a Railway station.
This room is rather spacious and has scores of [teller booths] with [steel] chain hanging between where the customer would stand and where the [tellers] took money or gave it out. A [sign] is here, above a [table] in the middle with [pamphlets] on it, and a thick [steel] door is open to the west, obviously leading to the vault. There is also a [deposit box] here. The treasury antechamber is to the south.
This room is huge, and in the light the [gold] and gems that line the walls and clutter the floors glitter and cast brilliant beams of light all about. There are piles and piles of valuable items here, much more than you could ever imagine spending. To the east is the antechamber.
The once great and shining temple of the One [God], Kraxis, has been desecrated. Animal [dung] has been smeared on the beautiful wall [murals], many of the [tiles] of the floor have been ripped up and thrown across the room, and the [altar], a single [large rock, unhewn] by hands, has the [statue] of a [pig-headed god] on top of it. The [large] main [doors] lie to the east.
This palace is quite beautiful, with many [mosaics] on the [floors] and several [tapestries] [hanging] on the walls. The [columns] that support the building are etched with [pictures] from Dwarven lore and are exquisitely done. However, despite the attention to beauty, there is little of anything of extreme cost here, for Dwarven craftsmanship is always ornate and admirable. The gates to the wall lead north to the Royal Road.
This palace rises high, probably consisting of ten or twelve floors, all carved out of the mountain. The walls are covered with beautiful [murals and tapestries], the floors are mosaics with fountains and [baths] interrupting them. Many [gold and silver objects] sit here gleaming in the light. It is clearly a wealthy abode. To the south is the gate that leads to the main street.
The [throne] room is much more simple and quaint than you might expect. A [large tapestry] hangs behind the [throne] itself and a long red carpet leads from the great doorway to the east, and except for the [throne] itself, there is little here.
This shack is rather empty except for a [small hay pile] and a [blanket], obviously someone's [bed], and a rather [large] iron [chest] with a peculiar looking [lock]. Other than that this [small] space only contains a few necessities of life. The doorway leads west to the town square.
This room is very plain and has half a dozen [desks and chairs] where the scriveners would sit and write documents for those who could not read.
Great stone [ovens] line the back wall here, and [old and rotted bags of flour and wheat] lay in a far back corner. A small [pipe] leads from outside, though one of the walls, and is pouring [water] into a small [cistern] that would have provided the bakers with the [water] they needed.
In this room you see the [tools] of a clothier's trade, generally dwarven shaped [wooden mannequins], a [table] for [cutting], and other [tools] scattered about.
Here you see  a long street with many stone [stairways] leading up to heavy wooden [doors]. They range from being three or [four] feet off the ground to nearly fifty feet from the stone floor. The [doors] will all be locked and barred, and only the families' special [keys] will be able to open the [doors]. A stairway leads down and southeast to the main hall.
You are standing in the Chief's office. He is telling you "The Mayor was murdered yeaterday night at 12:03 am. I want you to solve it before we get any bad publicity or the FBI has to come in. "Yessir!" You reply. He hands you a sheet of [paper]. Once you have read it, go north or west.
You are in a McDonalds. You pay the guy behind the counter. Now there is a [hamburger] there. When you have picked it up, go north.
It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny [sparrowhawk] wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty [air] above. There is a steep [pathway] to the south leading down into [dense woodland], and you can make out an old [building] by the [path]. In the distance you can just glimpse the [steel-grey] of the [sea], far away to the west.
An old, thatched [building] stands near the [path]. It seems to be an abandoned [inn] or [tavern], as a faded [sign] reads '[Troll's] [Arms']. The [walls] are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The [windows] are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of [mildew and decay]. [Weeds] grow between the [flagstones] of the [path] leading up to the [door], which leans open. No-one seems to have lived here for years. A [path] leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west.
There are a few patches of [mould] on the [walls] and the [floorboards] creak slightly, but the [building] seems safe enough. As you move you disturb a thin layer of [dust]. There are some [stone steps] leading down, and an open [doorway] to the outside to the west. You see some [tables and chairs]. There is a [dark], intricately-[carved] [wooden chair] in the corner behind you.
The [cellar] seems to have been formed from a natural [cavern] in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep - [casks] and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the [remains] of some old [barrels], but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn [above], where there is a flight of steep [stone] steps. By the far west [wall] stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the [floor] like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark [opening]. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional [dry, rustling sound] coming from deep inside the [darkness]. The uneven [floor] is covered in [dust], and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot-[prints].
Water seeps around the soles of your boots and fills your recent footprints. You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh-gas coming to the surface. There is an abandoned inn to the east, and a [path] leads south into the forest. To the west there seems to be a [little] country road.
A country [road stretches] to the south, its gravelled surface crunching slightly beneath your boots. It is bordered by [trees] and old [hedgerows]. Towards the east is a patch of swampy ground.
A gravelled country road leads north. A white-painted wooden [signpost] points west, where you can make out the sea. You can just glimpse the glint of more water through the [trees], far to the south.
A stretch of uneven [waste ground] stands closeby to a [castle]. There are old [dunes] covered in spiky patches of [marram and couch grass]. You can make out the old [castle] and its buildings away to the north. The blue-grey of the [sea] curves [around] in a wide arc to a beach towards the south.
The ruined [forge] stands just outside the [castle]. There is no [roof], and the remains of thick stone [walls] are open to the [sky]. The [castle] itself is closeby to the north, its stone towers soaring upwards. There is desolate wasteland stretching away to the south.
The [opening] to a deep [cave] leads eastwards into [darkness]. The [air] near the entrance smells rather stale and musty, and altogether rather unpleasant. The [path] into the forest winds south, and to the north is some swampy ground.
Nestling in a clearing amongst the trees is a tiny, thatched [cottage]. Smoke rises gently from the [chimney]. The little [garden] is badly overgrown, but the [path] leading to the [doorway] is fairly clear. You notice that the peeling door stands slightly open, but it has no knob or handle. The [path] leads south deeper into the trees, and continues north.
The [cottage] has a homely, lived-in feel but is a little untidy. A [fire] burns in the [grate]. Someone has obviously been here recently,  but there is no-one [around]. The [door] is somehow shut tight, and you see no [keyhole] or [door]-knob.
Grey-green [ferns] brush your ankles as you move along the [path], and the [light] filters dimly through the branches and leaves overhead. You hear the soft [calls of woodland] [birds]. The [pathway] leads north and continues west, deeper into the [forest].
The twisting [path] leads through an ancient [forest]. [Red and blue butterflies] dance above the [grass] and you can hear the soft [calls of wood-pigeons] in the [trees]. The leaves rustle gently in the morning breeze. The [pathway] leads east deeper into the [forest] and continues north, winding into the [trees]. There is an old [tree]-[stump] next to the [path] where once a great oak [tree] must have stood. It seems to be [hollow] in the centre.
Dragonflies hum and hover, and you hear the occasional [splash] of feeding [fish]. You have a feeling of tranquility instilled by the placid, lazy [waters]. There is a little [path] winding between dense [trees] towards the south. You can see the start of a deserted [gravel] [road] to the north, and you can just make out the [sea] to the west.
You hear the crashing sound of [waves] in your ears. White [gulls] wheel and play in the [sky] above, and you can taste the salt-spray on your lips. [Pebbles] crunch beneath your feet as you move. You can see the ruins of an old stone [lighthouse] to the south. There is a wasteland of [sand dunes] to the north, and forest trees to the east.
The ferocious power of ancient storms has long ago broken down and collapsed the [lighthouse] tower. There are the dense [trees] of a forest to the east, and more mountains in the far distance. Towards the north is a beach where the white surf hisses on the shingle and pebbles. The [entrance] to the [ruined] [lighthouse] is south. You can hear the cry of [gulls] in the cool, clear [air].
You stand in the [ruins] of a round room which is open to the [sky]. There are several narrow windows, and the [floor] is of rough, grey [flagstones]. Everywhere seems to be deserted. There is a narrow [passageway] in the eastern [wall], leading into darkness. The [passage roof] looks a little unsafe.
The hulk of a massive, stone [castle] towers into the [sky] above you. The [walls] are covered in grey [lichen and moss], and seem to have stood here since the beginning of time itself. Set into the [wall] to the north you can see a large oak [door], dark and weathered. There is a [keyhole] surrounded by a black [iron] plate. The ruins of the [castle] forge lie to the south. The [door] is locked, and there is no other way inside.
High on the tallest [tower] in the castle, the wind tugs and snatches at your clothing and hair. The [ground] is far [below] you. Heavy [stone battlements] edge the [parapet], and you have an excellent [view] across the [surrounding] [countryside].
The cave [floor] is moist from condensation, and your flickering [candle] casts pools of pallid light which sway and dance through the shadows. Here and there on the [walls] you notice [strange, ugly designs and runes] crudely drawn in [red and brown] [ochre]. Two pillars of rock seem to cascade from the roof, one streaming down like lumpy, white icing and the other formed from many tight needles of pinkish-[brown] [stalactites]. Between them is an opening that leads towards the south, and there are [passages] leading east and west.
The emptiness of a natural [cathedral of living] rock rises high into darkness above you, far beyond the reach of your [candlelight]. The sound of your footsteps echoes strangely. There are many [stalactites and stalagmites], some of which have joined to form delicate [pillars], others just hang like creamy icicles in the still, crisp [air]. Frozen rivers of snow-white rock spill down from the [ceiling] beside a dark [fissure] that spits the southern [wall]. Occasionally you see [fireflies] dancing and darting between the columns of pale stone. You are aware of the immense mass of the ancient mountains above.
This place, deep in the mountain heart, seems dreamlike and somehow magical. Distorted formations of twisted rock rise from the [cave floor], while gossamer traceries of stone seems to [float] in the air to create delicate screens and alcoves. Everywhere hang pale stalactites. The [floor] of the chamber is covered in red dust and pieces of broken white [bone].
You are south of an old wooden [shack], apparently deserted. The trail extends from northeast to southwest here, circling the Lonely [Mountain], which lies to the southeast. The sun is rising over the lands to the east.
An empty [jug] lies in a corner of the [room], against the overturned table. The top of a battered [lantern] is partially visible behind the overturned table.
The trail turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast and southwest. The [ground] is higher here than to the south, allowing you to make out the top of the Lonely [Mountain], shrouded in clouds. No path from here leads up the [mountain], however.
The sun has now risen above the [hills].
The trail ends here. A ruined stone [foundation] marks the site of the Old Lingolf [House], which presumably was a monument of some sort. The trail head is off to the southwest, and a small [brook] flows slowly by.
You are at a fork in the road where paths to the northwest and southwest girdle the base of the Lonely [Mountain] and a smaller path winds its way to the east.
You are on a road which enters a small village to the southwest and comes to a fork to the northeast. The Lonely [Mountain] looms above but there is no path from here which ascends the [mountain].
This is the [castle's] village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the [castle], and a less-used trail heads north up the [mountain].
You are on an east-west road, which wends its way through the dark, rolling [hills] of this land. To the west rises a high [mountain], to the east stands a high [castle] with dark [towers].
You are outside the western entrance to the [castle]. To the east stands an iron [gate] which is closed and [chained]. A winding road starts here and proceeds to the west.
You are just inside what appears to be the main entrance to the [castle]. An iron [gate], standing wide open, looms to the west. Through it, a narrow road can be seen winding through low, smoky [hills]. Before you, to the east, is a huge open [courtyard]. To the north and the south are [archways] leading to the interior of the [castle].
You are on a long pebbled path, stretching out to the north. To the south the path continues through an open arch into an open [area].
This is the base of the northwest tower of the [castle]. A winding [staircase] leads up into the tower itself, and passages lead from here to the east and south.
There is an ornamented [egg] here, both beautiful and complex. It is carefully crafted and bears further examination.
This is the western end of the Hall of [Mirrors]. The hall itself is astounding and not a little bit confusing. To be sure, its northern [wall] is [glass], but it does not seem to reflect anything within the hall. [Rather], it seems to be a window on another world. This other world appears to be a large underground [labyrinth], filled with [tunnels], [caves], and peculiar rock [formations]. Your mouth is getting [rather] dry.
This is a spot within the long Hall of [Mirrors].
This is the eastern end of the Hall of [Mirrors].
This small open [area] stands at the old north [gate] of the [castle], now badly rusted. Through the [gate], a forest can be seen. To the west, a hall glows with light, and to the south, the dark [castle] can be reentered. A narrow passage to the east leads to the base of the northeast tower.
Discarded beneath a nearby [tree] is a slightly crumpled [scroll].
The sounds of [frogs] and other [swamp] dwellers fill the air.
To the south you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural [voices]. Amid the tubes is an old and dusty [book].
This narrow promenade stretches into darkness to the south and, through an [archway], toward an open [area] to the north.
This dark and damp spot is at the base of the southwest tower of the [castle]. Two corridors lead off to the north and east. A winding [staircase] ascends into the tower.
The darkening [sky] is lit by a waning moon. There is a fourposter feather [bed] here.
(You are in the fourposter feather [bed].) The eyrie is a round [bedroom] high in the tower. Narrow windows overlook the outside. A stone [stairway] leads down.
The damp corridor continues east and west from here. A dark and forbidding [stairway] leads down to the south. In addition, a narrow passage leads to the north.
A dank and forgotten pit contains the dungeons. There is a cell to the north, and a partly blocked passage leads even deeper into the earth. It looks as if there was once a mortared stone [wall] blocking this passage, but it has crumbled and collapsed, reopening the tunnel.
This is a damp and unhealthy dungeon cell with [writing] on the [walls]. The rusty [door] of the cell is open.
Lying on the [ground], and slightly damaged, is a stained [scroll]. Lying near the door is a silver [spoon], discarded by the prisoners as too soft to dig with. It is only slightly worn.
The east-west corridor opens into a gallery. The [walls] are lined with [portraits], some of apparently great value. All of the eyes seem to follow you as you pass, and the entire [room] is subtly disturbing.
This is a meadow near the [sea]. There is a smell of salt in the air. Only [heather and thistles] grow here. To the north is a [gate] leading into the [castle]. A narrow path to the southeast leads to the shore of the [Sea].
Crawling slowly along the beach is an enormous [turtle], his enamelled [shell] shining with all the colors of the rainbow.
An enormous [turtle] is here, its enamelled [shell] shining with all the colors of the rainbow.
"Crash!" A huge [hammer] smashes against the stone floor.
In the exact center of the [room] is a large, jewelled [box]. It is wrapped in tight [coils] of thin [rope]. You try to follow the strands with your eye, but become hopelessly lost in the jumble of thousands of loops and [knots].
To the north you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural [voices].
This is a small prison cell in the north tower of the temple. Hideous [shapes] can be seen through the iron-barred window in the prison [door]. From the temple, a blood-curdling chant can be heard.
This is the [altar] of the temple. Acrid smoke fills the air, and a feeling of lurking evil is all around. A low [droning], just at the lowest end of your perception, causes your hair to stand on end. Behind the [altar] is an enormous [statue] of a demon which reaches toward you with dripping [fangs] and razor-sharp [talons]. The [fangs and talons] are blood-red. In the temple below is a mass of hunched figures, chanting in hideous tones.
This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the [altar], which, atop a row of [stairs], is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind the [altar] is an enormous [statue] of a demon which seems to reach towards you with dripping [fangs] and razor-sharp [talons]. Two open [doorways] lead out of the temple to the east and west, while two wooden [doors] stand at the north and south. A [mass] of hunched [figures] in the temple are chanting a haunting tune. They don't seem interested in your presence.
You are in the center of a large [courtyard], which surrounds you. Everything around you is ashen and grey, and the air seems miasmic and oppressive. The dead [grass] seems to grab at your feet as you stand gazing around. To the east is a temple flanked by two smaller towers. Behind it can be seen the two eastern towers of the [castle], shrouded in blood-red fog. Between them is a dark turret, black and ominous as night. It sends dark streams of smoke curling around everything near it. From the temple can be heard a mournful chant.
This is the westernmost point in a large open [courtyard]. The huge entrance gate to the [castle] looms ominously to the west. The [courtyard] widens as it proceeds to the east, where a large, ivy-covered temple stands. On either side of the temple are small towers. Far beyond the temple, high above, are two large towers marking the corners of the [castle]. A squat dark turret hunches between them, blackening the [sky] around it. A small path leads into the [castle] to the south.
There is a bedraggled and weary [adventurer] standing here. He is carrying a brass [lantern], and a [sword]. He seems pleased to see you and frequently smiles in your direction. The [adventurer] leaves the [room], heading to the west.
Lying on the [ground] is an old [parchment] [map]. Lying on the floor is a purple [scroll]. In one corner of the [room] is a badly worn [pencil], inscribed with [runes]. You are very thirsty now. You'd better have a drink soon.
This is a peculiar [room], whose cream-colored [walls] are thin and translucent. An exit is to the south and it is very strange indeed, perfectly round and black as pitch.
[Passages] go to the west, southwest, and southeast and they are very strange indeed, perfectly round and black as pitch.
[Passages] go to the northwest and southeast and they are very strange indeed, perfectly round and black as pitch.
[Passages] go to the northwest and southwest and they are very strange indeed, perfectly round and black as pitch.
An exit is to the northeast and it is very strange indeed, perfectly round and black as pitch. A [scroll] emanating power is here.
The wall is cylindrical here, with exits east and west. The eastern one opens into a dark, enclosed space. The air is thick with acrid smoke, and black, greasy [ashes] mar the floor. The mortar and stones of the [walls] are stained and crumbly.
This is a winding [stair], stretching up and down out of sight. The [walls] are mossy and damp. An exit leads west to a landing.
A [dragon], spouting [flame], approaches! The [warlock] [Krill], robed in black, stands before you, in eager anticipation of your death. [Krill] looks your way and spits: "You were fortunate, wizard-worm, to have survived our last encounter. But your trivial [spells] of protection will not save you now!" The [dragon] engulfs you in [flame]. As you perish, you can hear [Krill's] mocking laughter.
The [Neil Armstrong] Middle and Elementary [School] Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now. There's an exit to the west; and a [door] to the north leads to the [Enterprise] [closet], where materials for your special task of the day are stored.
This rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business. The closet is packed with piles of [soft drinks] for the [school] vending machines and sports a tall set of [shelves], mostly  for [school] supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods. Today, one [shelf] has been reserved for [candy grams] and other materials for  the day's deliveries.
This hall runs north toward the main entrance and south toward some rest rooms. Mr. [Alltext's] room is to the west, and there are other [classrooms] off the northern and southern parts of the corridor. The cafeteria is to the east.
This is part of a rather plain, hall, running north to south. To the north is the end of the hall. The midpoint of the hall is to the south. Mr. [Pisces' room, Room] 7, is to the east.
This is the [classroom] usually occupied by [Mr. Pisces], a colorful young science [teacher], known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers. Unfortunately, he is also well-known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.
This is part of a rather nondescript north-south hallway. The midpoint of the hall is to the north, and its south end is to the south. Mr. [McDell's classroom] is to the east. Outside the [classroom] there are some student [lockers].
This is a social studies [classroom], usually inhabited by the large and lively [Mr. McDell]. The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a [mural] showing an American [Revolution] battle scene on the back [wall] and a large [box] full of [costumes] that [students] sometimes use in skits they develop.
This is the south end of rather long north-south hallway. Ms. [Garrulous'] [classroom] is to the west. To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.
This is the well-stocked [math classroom of Ms. Garrulous]. It has lots of [colorful posters], a [small refrigerator, and pictures of family] members--all the comforts of home.
This is the end of a rather plain hall, running north to south. To the north is the building's main [entranceway], which opens [automatically] whenever one approaches it. [School] rules clearly prohibit you from going outside during the [school] day. Ms. [Empirious'] [room, Room] 8, is to the west.
This is the science [classroom] usually occupied by [Ms. Empirious], a young science [teacher] whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle [school] legend. A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the [door] reads, "Abandon hope, all you who enter here." Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.
Here, the corridor turns to the west. The administrators' office suite is to the north, and the main classroom wing of the middle [school] is to the southeast. There's a [poster] here, inviting students to sign up early for [spring] after-[school] activities.
You're in the east-west hallway, west of the [school] office. To the north, you see the classroom of Ms. [Picasso], your English teacher of two years ago, when you were a sixth grader. The hallway continues to the west, toward the elementary [school] part of the building, where middle [schoolers] are not supposed to go there without a special pass.
Actually, this is the outer or "Student Office" part of the [school's] administrative area. It has all the usual office appointments, including a long counter that separates the secretaries' area from the rest of the room.
At this point in the east-west hallway, you can see Ms. [Fuerstein's] classroom to the south. This class is a collaborative effort, financed by several surrounding towns, for the benefit of kids with a variety of relatively severe learning problems, ranging from developmental delay to mild forms of autism. Though some of Ms. [Fuerstein's] students are of middle [school] age, others are younger, and so her [room] is on the elementary-[school] side of the building. You see a colorful [drawing of flowers] here.
Room 10 is a [small], colorful [classroom] that seems to be home to four [students], at the moment, along with their [teacher] and a student volunteer, [Alicia], whom you've been seeking. You know that, sometimes, there are two or three other [kids] here, along with a couple of aides, but, right now, the others are probably attending regular [classes] in which they are "mainstreamed."
This is the [classroom of Ms. Picasso], a [teacher] of Grade Six English. The room has an open, modern look, and the [students] are assembled in a U-shaped configuration, facing a [whiteboard], on which appears most of a [poem] entitled "Prejudice."
An [old pedlar] is sitting on a [log] here, tending to his [bunions].
I'm on a [path winding] through the Enchanted [Forest]. The [path winds] its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking [trees] that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!
I'm at a fork in the [path]. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the [path] forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the [path] widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the [forest].
I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny [cottage] here complete with a thatched [roof] and leaded [windows]. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand-painted [sign] designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front [porch]. A little [path] lined by rows of white-painted [stones] leads around the side of the [house] to the west.
A [battered old dustbin] sits to one side of the [porch].
I'm in a little garden alongside the [cottage]. There's a [vegetable plot] in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a [somewhat] neglected [ornamental] [pond]. There's obviously been [some] attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle [potting shed] completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an [overgrown pergola] leads into a meadow.
Daisy the [cow] is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of [hay].
In the corner is an [old metal trunk] marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'
I'm at the top of the [beanstalk]. I was under the impression that these giant [beanstalks] all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the [roof] of the [cottage] from here.
I'm perched precariously on the [roof] of the [cottage], trying desperately not to look down. There is a [chimney] here attached to which is a TV [aerial]. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the [beanstalk] can be seen poking up above the [roofline].
I am in the bears' [tiny kitchen], a cosy [little] room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A [large dining table] sits in the centre of the room and there is a [dresser] against the wall. Opposite the [dresser] is an enormous brick [fireplace] that seems to fill half the room.
I'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the [mouse droppings] that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright [freezer] in the corner and [some] sturdy [shelves] stacked high with [box] after [box] of McScottie's [porridge oats]. The kitchen lies to the south.
I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the walls are [portraits] of various members of the Bear clan, along with [some] highly disturbing [hunting trophies]. A narrow [staircase] leads up to the bears' bedroom. The front [door] is closed. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten [bearskin rug].
The [Big Bad Wolf] is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous. A [tiny] dormer [window] looks out onto the clearing. For [some] unaccountable reason, [Sleeping Beauty] is lying fast asleep on the [tiny little bed].
From its [floral carpet] to its lovingly dusted [knick-knacks], The Three Bears' sitting room is a [chintzy] abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave. Three [chairs] are arranged around a [small coffee table]; a [large chair], a [medium-sized] [chair] and a [tiny little chair].
I'm in a dingy cellar with bare brick walls and the musty smell of a laundry room. There is an [old] upright [washing machine] in the corner and a [fusebox] on the wall. Steps lead up to the trapdoor in the ceiling. A [battered] [old wardrobe] stands against the western wall of the cellar.
This seems to be a small annex to the main part of the cellar. Everything about the decor of this place says 'dungeon' to me, from the guttering [torches] to the ragrolled paint effect on the [walls] that's meant to look like ancient stonework. Unfortunately the [rotting skeleton] manacled to the wall is only too real. A [sign] on the wall opposite the [skeleton] says 'When we say NO TRESPASSERS we mean NO TRESPASSERS!' [Something] for the bears' victims to think about while they languish in this dump. The passage leads south back to the cellar.
Two [chairs] are arranged around [small coffee table]; a [large chair] and a [medium-sized] [chair]. There used to be a [tiny little chair] but I'd rather not talk about it. There's a low-pitched hum coming from [somewhere].
I'm in an underground [cave]. From the decor I'd say this was Papa Bear's private [den], a place of sanctuary away from the rigours of family life. The [walls] are plastered with [posters] of football teams and [pin-ups] from 'Playbear.' A [solid metal door], set into the western [wall] of the [cave] looks almost impenetrable. There's an [electric socket] in the [wall] next to the [door]. The [large chair] is now facing a [television] set and there's a [fridge] within easy reach of the [chair].
This must be where Papa Bear does all his D.I.Y. It's a small but tidy workshop with a [bench] and an [old filing cabinet] in the corner. Pinned to the walls are what appear to be the [blueprints] for various devices.
On the [doormat] is a [pile] of junk [mail].
You can enter your [home] to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south.
The road runs from your [home], to the north, toward the village [Pub], to the west.
Ford [Prefect] is here. There is [lots of beer] here. There is a [barman] serving at the [bar]. Behind the [bar] is a [shelf]. It is full of the sort of [items] you find on [shelves] behind [bars] in [pubs].
You can see [nothing], feel [nothing], hear [nothing], taste [nothing], smell [nothing], and are not entirely certain who you are.
This is the cabin of the Vogon [Captain]. You and [Ford] are strapped into [poetry] appreciation [chairs]. The [Captain] is indescribably hideous, indescribably blubbery, and indescribably mid-to-dark green. He is holding [samples] of his favourite [poetry].
There is a sales [brochure] here.
There is a molecular hyperwave [pincer] here.
This is one end of a short corridor that continues aft along the main deck of the [Heart of Gold]. Doorways lead to fore and port. In addition, a [gangway] leads upward.
A [carton] labelled "[Nutrimat]/Computer Interface" is sitting here.
This is one end of a short corridor that continues fore along the main deck of the [Heart of Gold]. [Doorways] lead to aft and port. In addition, a [gangway] leads downward. [Marvin], the Paranoid [Android], is here.
The Ravenous Bugblatter [Beast of Traal] is here, looking particularly nasty and hungry.
Some sharp [stones] lie near the exit to the west.
The [skeleton] of a dead [Beasthunter] lies nearby, clutching something labelled "Nutrimat/Computer [Interface]."
Phil is here. [Arthur Dent] is here. You notice the [hostess] approaching, but using several mingling couples as cover you maneuver away.
You are in the [stomach] of a sperm [whale]. You can hear a distant sound of rushing wind. There is a [flowerpot] here.
You are [piloting] the [speedboat], which features very simple [controls], toward the [island of France] (Footnote 3), where the dedication ceremonies for the Heart of Gold will occur. You are currently steering the [boat] toward a narrow [channel] between towering [cliffs] and a [rocky] [spire]. There is a tool [box] here. (outside the [pilot seat])
There is a [pilot seat] here.
This is a platform surrounded by a [crowd]. Several members of the [crowd] are holding a huge [banner]. Just to the east is the Heart of Gold.
This is part of a spongy gray [maze] of twisty little [synapses], all alike.
There is a thermo-fusion [chisel] here.
This tiny area, with an exit to port, is for working on the hatch [mechanism], which is vastly more complicated than your rather ordinary intelligence can comprehend. The floor is an open metal [mesh], like the floor of a catwalk.
The wind moans. Dust drifts across the surface of the alien world. [Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian] appear and urge you forward.
You're standing in front of the [house] where you spent many of your summers as a youngster. The old [place] is not as big as it seemed to you then, but it is still quite large. Stone pathways wind east and west around the [house], and a larger main walkway leads north.
This is the front porch of the [house] with its towering white pillars. Next to the front [door] is a regulation [mailbox] endorsed by Buck Palace. Beneath the [mailbox] is a [doorbell] once rung by Sonny Tufts. To the south is a walkway.
This was your favorite [room] as a child. Each summer [Uncle Buddy] would have props and [models] from his various movies brought here for the amusement of his numerous guests. There is a scale [model of downtown] [Tokyo] here. [Doorways] lead south, east and west. There is a [door] to the north.
This is a short hall stretching east and west. Doorways lead north to the ladies' [room] and south to the men's [room].
This is the [screening] [room] where Uncle Buddy died. He had a massive heart attack while viewing the final cut of his first horror musical, "A Corpse Line." The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full-length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed "A Corpse Line" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre-like [seats] face a movie [screen]. Doorways lead south and west.
This cramped [area] is just big enough for one person and all the equipment. A thick [glass] window overlooks the [screening] [room] to the north.
This is the living [room] where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde used spend their evenings. Most of the west wall is covered by a grand stone [fireplace] with a [mantle] over it. A long [sofa], several cushy [chairs] and a [telephone] fill the [room]. Most of the hardwood floor is covered by a monstrous Persian [rug]. A doorway leads north and an archway exits to the east.
This is a long hall stretching east and west. There is a [painting] hanging here.
This is the parlor where Uncle Buddy would bring his special guests. He would break out his finest scotch and Cuban cigars. Once [they] were tight he would present his latest movie idea. (You've seen his movies, so you know anyone who would agree to invest in one of them had to have been drinking.) Strange, you notice all the furniture in this [room] is bolted to the floor, except for the [piano] in the middle of the [room]. A [doorway] leads west.
This is the northern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. It appears as though this [room] was under construction. To the north, about a [foot] above the floor, you see an entrance to a passage. The entrance is partially blocked by the floor of the [room] above. A beam runs east-west across the [ceiling], forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the south. There is a [niche] in the [ceiling] here. In the [niche] there is a dusty [pillar] supporting the [ceiling].
This is the southern half of an uncomfortably warm crawl space beneath the parlor. A beam runs east-west across the [ceiling], forming the boundary between this side of the crawl space and the other half to the north.
In the [niche] there is a square [pillar] supporting the [ceiling].
This is a small passage which ends here. It looks like the construction of this [room] was never completed.
This is a large fieldstone patio spanning the entire width of the back of the [house]. In the daytime you can look out onto Aunt Hildegarde's beautiful [garden], said to be the envy of the Malibu colony. This is where Uncle Buddy and Aunt Hildegarde would often entertain.
You're in a small [closet]. Mounted at an angle on the back wall of the [closet] are three coat [pegs]. To the left of the first [peg] there is a hole the size of a [peg]. To the right of the third [peg] there is [peg] which has been sawed-off, flush with the wall. The [door] to the north is open.
This is the middle of the upstairs hall. The hall stretches to the east and the west. To the south there is an open closet [door]. In the [ceiling] above you see the outline of a [panel]. You notice an unusual [newel] next to the [stairs] leading down.
It's a Hollywood bathroom. Everything from the temperature-controlled marble toilet [seat] to the Oscar statuettes for hot and cold [water] is overdone. The shower has a gold curtain and you can't help but notice the bath [mat] with Jack Valenti's picture on it.
There is a closed [window] here. A blue velvet [sack] is barely visible, stuck beneath the closed [window].
This is a spare [bedroom] where guests would stay if [they] couldn't drive home after one of the parties. The [bed] is big and fluffy and all the furniture is padded well. Uncle Buddy put two brass [handles] on the floor so guests would have something to hang onto when the [room] began to spin. A doorway leads north.
The [fireplace] is finely crafted masonry, but has long been neglected. The mortar is crumbling in a number of [places]. One brick, about waist high, seems particularly loose. The [fireplace] opens to the east.
You're in the [chimney], above the fireplace. You can see a couple of holes here in the [chimney] where bricks used to be. The [chimney] continues upward and the fireplace is below.
You're inside the [chimney].
The [chimney] continues upward and downward.
You're doing your best to keep your balance here on the roof. During a fierce storm you can see Linda Ronstadt's house wash into the ocean from here. A [chimney] juts up from the roof here and there is another [chimney] to the east, near the end of the roof.
This is the east end of the roof. A [chimney] juts up from the roof here and there is another [chimney] off to the west, near the end of the roof.
You're standing in the [chimney]. There are a couple of holes here in the [chimney] where bricks used to be. This [chimney] doesn't lead any further down, only up.
This is the dining [room]. There is a long table and [chairs] here. Doorways lead east, west and south.
This is Aunt Hildegarde's kitchen. It is a fairly large, sterile [area] with several pieces of commercial-grade equipment to [handle] the vast amount of food needed for Hollywood parties. It is not exactly the kind of homey kitchen most people's aunts have. The whole family remembers the Christmas everyone received fruit cakes with serial numbers on them. A doorway leads to the east and [stairs] lead down from here.
You are in a musty [cellar]. One of Uncle Buddy's old movie props, a huge, over-teched [computer] is here. There is a closed [closet door] to the south. A [staircase] leads up.
You're standing on a stone walkway in Aunt Hildegarde's much envied [garden] where she would spend hours tending to her flowers, bushes and trees. The [garden] was off limits to you as a child because of an incident one summer when you and Cousin Herman were playing in the [garden]. You suggested pretending to be wild African animals and climbed a tree and began to screech like a baboon while Cousin Herman ran off toward the roses shouting something about being a rhinoceros.
You're standing on a stone walkway in the tulip section of the [garden]. The walkway leads northeast and southeast.
You are in the orchid section of the [garden]. Tender orchid petals of every color surround a small [pond] here. The stone walkway leads north, southeast and southwest.
This is the entrance to the hedge [maze]. Aunt Hildegarde told you never to go into the [maze] without the [map], and of course you would go in anyway and she would have to come in and find you.
You are in a hedge [maze] of astonishing complexity. Paths lead north, south, east and west.
In this corner of the backyard you can make out the enormous hedge, which is part of the estate's hedge [maze]. The stone walkway splits in three [directions] here: north, along the dark and towering hedge; south, past the fragrant and inviting [garden]; and west, where the walkway cuts a straight and narrow path between the hedge and the [garden]. A slightly worn path in the grass heads east.
This is a [cannon] emplacement complete with a Civil War-style [cannon] and a neatly stacked pyramid of [cannon balls]. During the day this [area] affords a spectacular view of the coastline. Stone walkways lead east and west, and a steep path leads down.
This is the end of a beach which stretches to the east. The fine white [sand] underfoot reflects the [light]. A slight breeze blows off the [ocean] to the north. A wooden landing is south of here, and an inlet lies west.
You are in a large grotto standing on a boat dock. Moonlight trickling through the grotto's opening to the north reflects off the [water], dimly illuminating this [area]. A wooden walkway leads north out of the grotto. A [pool of sea water] covers the bottom of the grotto.
You are swimming on the surface of the [pool]. The [water] sparkles, reflecting the [light] coming in from an opening to the north. To the east is a boat dock.
As you swim underwater you can see faint [light] above you and darkness below.
You feel a mild current flowing east. You have to grit your teeth to keep them from chattering in the cold [water].
You are swimming on the surface of a [pool] inside a small grotto. To the north is a small ledge.
Your soggy [footsteps] echo through the long, slimy corridor which runs up, towards a dry [area], and south, toward dripping noises.
This [place] looks like a bomb shelter. The plain concrete [walls] and floor remind you of a prison cell. A heavy-duty [sawhorse] has a heavy wooden [plank] across it. Suspended above the left [end] of the [plank] by a rope is a [safe]. The rope stretches from the [safe], through a pulley in the [ceiling], to the floor where it is tied to a [pipe] running along the wall. In the [ceiling] above the right [end] of the [plank] there is a closed [hatch]. A long [chain] hangs down from the [hatch]. Just beneath the [hatch] there is a pair of heavy-duty metal [hooks] protruding from the wall. There is a doorway leading south.
Suspended above the left [end] of the [plank] by a [rope] which is burning, is a [safe].
In the [ceiling] above the right [end] of the [plank] there is an open [hatch].
This [cliff] affords the same spectacular view as from the cannon emplacement above. Far below you and stretching east, you see the white sands of a beach, illuminated by the moon's glow. You can hear the faint sound of waves lapping at the shore. Nearby in the [ground] is an open [hatch], forming a [hole] which leads down.
You are in the overpoweringly fragrant rose [bush] section of the [garden]. As you admire the roses by the full moon's [light], you notice one somewhat sickly rose [bush]. The stone walkway leads northwest and southwest.
This is a dusty old attic with cobwebs hanging from the [ceiling] rafters. The attic is empty except for a dusty [trunk] and a folding [ladder] attached to a [panel] in the floor. To the south there is an open [door].
This is a vault filled with props. You can see Aunt [Hildegarde] tied to a buzz [saw]. Cousin [Herman] is here, thinking of something rotten to do to you. To the east there is a [chute].
You glance around again. The cave [narrows] [ahead], a [tight crawl] winding around folds of [limestone]. A [low passage descends] to your [right], and there is a [side chamber] on the [left].
This is the bottom of a wide pit. The [walls] are entirely unclimbable, of course. The floor is [rippled] and uneven, rising to [sharp blades of stone] near the edge. [Mud] and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but there's no [standing water], so -- yes -- a [narrow crawl] leads down in the far corner.
You're on your [hands] and knees in a throat of [stone]. The [roof] dips even lower [ahead]. If you [advance], it'll be squirming [forwards] on your belly. And squirming [backwards] will be impossible, you think grimly.
The [crawl] is no different here than anywhere. You have just enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see [ahead] but more [stone] to [crawl] through.
The rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length now, your [arms] stretched out [ahead], but still rough [stone] scrapes your shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.
You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your [back] is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected [stone]. A [cold] stony knot presses into your left side, your right knee.
You are lying in [cold still water]. It licks at your cheek and [arms], and across the [backs] of your [thighs]. The chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No room.
Water trickles over your [hands], but the floor must have risen; there is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.
You are in a [smallish] roundish cave. [Gravel and small rock chips] cover the [ground]. Water trickles audibly, somewhere nearby. A [path] runs [right], a [steep crack] heads [left], and a [pit] climbs up.
You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting [canyon]. The [walls] spread upward around you. And the [distant roof] is hung with glimmering [stars] -- droplet-tipped [stalactites] in some hidden suffusion of [light]. A [crevice] runs along the [canyon] at your [feet]. You can cross it and continue on [ahead], or re-enter the [crawl behind] you.
Massive [buttresses of stone] rise all around you, climbing the canyon [wall], flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A [path] seems to climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.
You are partway up the canyon [wall], on a narrow [path] that climbs from [ledge] to [ledge]. The cavern is vast around you, water-hewn strata stretching upward to the [stone] forest of the [roof]; and somewhere above you, a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering...
(You are in the army [cot].) You are in your [tent]. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open [tent flaps] on the southern [wall], but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the [tent] would be bearable if only the [air] stirred, even a little. At the foot of the [cot] is a large, unwieldy [trunk]. The [trunk] is closed and [locked] with a [padlock].
There is an army [cot] here.
You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your [tent]. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the [desert], the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small [hole] in the [sand], a remnant of your excavation attempts.
You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply [tent], its [flaps] open, still in the hot, quiet [air]. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of [thickets], impossible to make any progress through even with a [machete], grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the [tent].
Stuck in the [sand], handle down, is a small pick [axe]. Half buried in the [sand], in the corner of the [tent], is a [shovel].
You are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work [tent]. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your [tent]. The work [tent] borders an endless vista of fine, burning [sand] stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged [hole] in the [sand], a remnant of your excavation attempts.
Tacked up to the inside of one of the [tent flaps] is a [note]. Sitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten-up [knapsack].
Half covered with sand is a bright piece of [foil] which catches your eye. Sitting by a [rock] is what looks like a matchbook.
A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing [desert].
You are on the bank of the [river Nile]. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south [thickets] make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling [water] to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought -- [crocodiles] bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their [watery] domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.
You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they [deserted] you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here.
You are in the [desert], still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The [tents], shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge.
You are in the [desert], out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the [desert], a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand.
You are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the [walls] themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the [walls] meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long-dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four [staircases] descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone [altar] mounted solidly in the floor. Lying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster [jar]. Leaning against the [altar] is a bronze [torch].
You are on a landing in the middle of a set of [stairs]. The [staircase] goes down to the south and up to the north. The [walls] here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built.
You are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the [wall] are some [hieroglyphs].
You're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the [boat] by going south.
You are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The [walls] of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.
You are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large [doorway] cut into the stone [walls] lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.
You are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high [walls], making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with [pillars] on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the [paintings] on the [walls, pictures] of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.
You are in the temple's inner chamber. The ceiling here is lower, low enough for your light to reach it. There are [openings] in the east and west [walls], and a large, arched [doorway] to the south. The [walls] are covered with [paintings], most of which depict the Queen in different stages of preparation for her trip on the royal barge. One in particular, larger than any of the others, shows the Queen and all of her attendants aboard the barge, floating through the air on their way to the netherworld. There are some detailed [hieroglyphs] on one of the [walls]. Lying before you in tortured repose are the bony [remains] of a former [adventurer], someone who tried looting the pyramid long, long ago. As you bend over to pay your respects, something glitters, catching your eye as you move your head.
You are in a room whose [walls] are covered with gold [leaf]. Your light reflects off the [walls] with a rich, warm tone and reveals the outlines of [hieroglyphics] engraved in the gold itself. There is a doorway cut into the south wall and, through the reflected light, you can tell it leads into a small chamber. There is another doorway leading out to the east.
Sitting in the middle of the granite [table] is a gleaming [chalice] made of gold.
You are in the Silver Chamber, a room whose [walls] reflect your light brilliantly due to their silver surface. A doorway leads west and out, while another doorway leads into a smaller room to the south.
Sitting in the middle of the granite [table] is a [chalice] made of gleaming silver.
You are standing on the [deck] of an ancient [wooden] barge. Before you, cut into the [deck], is a [hole]. To the south is a plank which leads down off the barge. You can see two cabins on the [deck], one to the west and the other to the east. Before you, running down through a [hole] in the [deck], is a sturdy [beam] made of [wood]. Although only a few feet of it rise above the [deck], it was probably used at one time as a [mast].
Sitting on the [deck] is a papyrus [scroll].
You are in the aft cabin aboard the barge. There's a door to the west which leads out to the [deck], and a short [ladder], permanently mounted to the [deck], going down into the depths of the barge itself.
You are below the [deck] of the barge in what looks like a huge hold. To the west you can see the hold continuing, while a [ladder] leads up and out from here.
You are in the westmost portion of the hold, below the [deck] of the barge. On the north side of the hull is a small [knothole] about three feet off the [deck]. Overhead you can see a [hole] going through the [deck] while, directly below this [hole], on the [deck] by your feet, is a [slot]. Coming down through the [hole] above your head and ending in the [slot] at your feet is the [beam] which served as a [mast].
Descending from above is the end of a long [rope]. As you peer down the dimly-lit hallways, you see that the doors in all four hallways are balanced halfway open. A large golden [cluster] sits on the floor. Sitting in the middle of the floor is a large [statue], about two feet shorter than you. It reminds you a little of Miss Ellingsworth.
You are midway down the Southwest Hallway. The [walls] of this narrow passage are unadorned and smooth. The hallway continues to the southwest and the northeast. There is a large [statue] here.
You are standing midway down the long Northeast Hallway. The high [walls] are undecorated, but bear the marks of the stonecarver's tool. The hallway continues to the northeast and the southwest.
You are standing in a small room, that of the protective goddess Selkis. There are red, blue and green patterns on the [walls] formed from small glazed [tiles] that have been carefully arranged in order of shade. The darkest [tiles] border the floor, and become lightest near the ceiling. On one wall, inscribed in a beaten gold [panel], is the [symbol] of Selkis, under which you can see some [hieroglyphic] text. An [opening] through the southwest wall leads out of this room. A beautiful ruby [cluster], sparkling like fire, sits on the floor.
This is the room of the protective goddess Isis. You stand in amazement in the center of the room as thousands of tiny [lights] twinkle around you. With great surprise you realize that the light from your [torch] is being reflected by the mirror-like surfaces of innumerable [quartzite] [chips]. These are set artfully into red clay [panels] in the [walls], and are surrounded by shiny red [jasper] fragments. On the southwest wall, under the winged [symbol] of Isis, some [hieroglyphic] text is inscribed in a gold panel. To the northeast is an arched [opening], and, looking through it, you can barely make out a hallway. Lying on the [ground] is a brilliant, glowing emerald [cluster].
You are standing in the middle of the Northwest Hallway. The [walls] here are smooth and undecorated, carved out of granite. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southeast.
You are midway down the Southeast Hallway. This corridor is undecorated and the [walls] are polished to a smooth lustre. The hallway continues to the southeast and the northwest.
You are standing in the room of the protective goddess Neith. This room seems dark and mysterious with its decorations of inky-blue lapis [lazuli] and jet-black [obsidian]. Gold [scrollwork] defines an area on one of the [walls], in the center of which is the [symbol] of Neith. Below this you can see some [hieroglyphs] etched into a beaten gold [panel]. There is a door in the northwest wall leading out of the room. An opal [cluster], glistening with the light of a thousand fires, lies on the floor.
You have entered the room of the protective goddess Nephthys. The [walls] here are cut from pink granite, elaborately decorated with bright red [carnelian] and pale yellow [feldspar]. Along the northeast wall are [panels] of beaten gold, and midway up this wall, under the winged [symbol] of Nephthys, you can see some [hieroglyphs]. To the southeast, an [opening] has been cut in the thick granite wall. A large diamond [cluster], glittering in your light, sits on the floor directly under the [hieroglyphs].
You are in a room whose [walls], floor and ceiling seem to form a perfect cube. There are four square doorways cut into the [walls] -- to the north, the south, the east and the west. Through the west doorway you can see a flight of [stairs] heading up.
You are in a room whose symmetry is uncanny, at least to the unaided eye: the dimensions of the room seem to form a perfect cube. There are two square doorways cut into the [walls] -- one to the north, and another to the east. The uncannily-shaped room seems to form a corner for this entire area.
There are two square doorways cut into the [walls] -- one to the north, and another to the west. A [panel], recessed into a wall, glows softly in your reflected light, while some [hieroglyphs] are visible above it.
You are at the top of a sixteen-step [stairway]. It leads west and down. The strange passageway into the cube rooms lies to the south. The [walls] here are painted in somber colors -- deep ochres, browns and blacks, but the scenes the [paintings] depict are oddly gay. Priests smile, their hands lifted up high to Amun Ra, offering flower petals in their palms, while a young girl, bedecked in black, stands by watching, a twisted smile on her face.
You are at the bottom of the sixteen-step [stairway]. The [stairway] goes up to the east, while to the west is solid [plaster]. Painted on the [plaster] are some [hieroglyphs].
You are at the east end of what seems like a long, straight passageway. After carefully looking over the [walls], stones and floor, you determine that it is safe to proceed.
You have reached the west end of the passage. Before you is a [door] surrounded by a heavy timber [frame]. The [door] is entirely blocked up with [plaster]. Toward the bottom of the north [wall] and the south [wall], about three inches off the floor, are two small [niches]. There are some [hieroglyphs] on the [plaster].
Through the [doorway] you can see the [beam] spanning the [pit].
You are in the southern end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. From here you can see the room stretching out towards the north. The south [wall] is painted to resemble large baskets of lotus flowers with their blue petals framing an image of the Sun God, Amun Ra. The west [wall] has a timber [doorway], inset several feet into the rocks, outlining a [door].
Wedged between the [doorway], from side to side, is the stout [beam]. Sitting in the middle of this room is a huge stone [slab]. Around its side runs a [seam] which is barely detectable. On top of the [slab] are four round [holes], one in each corner.
You are in the north end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. On the eastern and western [walls] are scenes carved in high relief depicting a royal figure, possibly meant to represent a new ruler, performing the ritual of the "[opening] of the mouth and eyes", the ceremony of restoring to the mummy of the departed Queen the use of its senses. The north wall of this area is a thick, solid wall of stone. In the center of this wall is a timber [lintel] on top of a [doorway].
You have entered the Chamber of Departure Towards the Funeral Destinies, the Burial Chamber. There is a [doorway] leading into a small room off to the east. In the middle of the chamber, stretching almost from wall to wall, is a huge, ancient [sarcophagus]. Its [cover] is composed of pure [quartz] and through the shining light you can see the golden, gleaming mummiform [coffin]. There is a small [recess] and a large [recess] on the top of the [cover] which you can make out as thin, outlined [areas]. Four [statues] surround the [sarcophagus], one in each corner: Isis, Nephthys, Neith and Selkis. Their outstretched [arms] clamp down tightly on the [quartz cover]. Wedged under the top of the [doorway], perpendicular to the floor, is the wooden [beam].
In the room is a large, granite [table]. Cut out from the top of this [table] are three circles of polished granite. The left [disc] is empty, and it is one inch above the top of the [table]. Sitting on the middle [disc] is a [scarab], and the middle [disc] is slightly below the top of the [table]. The right [disc] is empty, and it is one inch above the top of the [table].
On the ground is the ancient [jeweled amulet] that you "borrowed" from Mr. Meshugge.
Lying on the ground is a [brass torch] of the "self-igniting" type. The ignite button is on the handle. There is a shovel lying here.
You are at the bottom of the hole you just dug. The floor of the hole is a stone [slab] with a [little] [slot] in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!
This is a sandy pit with stone [walls]. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a [note] taped to the [wall].
You are in Francisco [Roboff's] tent. The place is bare except for the [emergency signal radio and Roboff's toilet] in one corner. There is a [note] taped to the tent [wall].
This room is at the peak of the [pyramid]. It is perfectly conical. In the center is a [tall stone obelisk] that you could probably use to get back up to the fake toilet. There are four stairways leaving the room at the four compass points.
There is a [tiny pebble] on the floor. Sitting on the [left disk] is: a [solid gold brick] Sitting on the [right disk] is: a [solid silver cube]
You are in a deep pit up to your chin in sticky grayish glue. You can probably climb out using a rough set of handholds on the east [wall]. (Probably carved by a previous sucker.)
The [walls] of this east/west corridor are thick panes of glass over the normal stone blocks. So is the floor which makes it hard to walk on your furry feet.
Sitting on the [shelf] is: a [beautiful silver necklace]
On the floor is a [small coin-bag] made of [leather]. It appears to have something in it.
This room is laid out like an exercise wheel for rats except that it is 40 ft. across. You can turn the wheel by walking north or south. Equally spaced around the rim are twelve [coin-holders]. Some have gold [coins] in them. The [coin-holder] at your feet has a [coin] in it. The hole is at the bottom of the wheel. Below it is the shaft that you entered this room by.
This is the north end of the [stalagmite] room. On the north [wall] is a [button] with something written on it. The only way out is back south.
West is a large round pit about 65 feet deep. Running down the center of the pit is an axle with a platform attached at the level of this hall. The platform is swinging around the [wall] of the pit. You see another hall west across the pit.
You are standing on a wooden platform swinging clockwise around the pit [wall]. The floor is 65 feet down but halls leave the pit at this level on the east and west sides.
Sitting on the [disk] is: a [iron key]
There is a small [figure] of a [demon] in carved [gold] here!
The corridor goes north to the stairs and south from here. There are alcoves to the east and west. In the floor between the alcoves is a [quartz window].
This alcove has a stone platform set in the floor. The platform shifts a [little] but does not move when you step on it. Sticking out of the platform is an [iron crank].
You are on the [crank] platform at the bottom of the shaft under the alcove. There is an opening to the east.
There is a [huge diamond] lying on the ground!
This is the south end of a long room. The [walls] and floor and ceiling are covered with thousands of [metal gadgets] that you might want to examine more carefully. There is a path free of [gadgets] to the north end of the room.
The [door] is open. You see something glimmering behind the [door]. You'll have to close the [door] to get it. The [chest] is closed and locked.
On the floor is the [solid-gold coffin] that contains the bodies of the Lord -- and all his riches! All you have to do is get it back to the encampment!
The starting point for the final leg of any campaign's pursuit of the Jewel of Knowledge. The rocky terrain is surprisingly cool considering how far beneath the Earth's surface you've traveled. Loose [lava rocks] lie scattered around the area and a gaping [hole] opens up in the [ceiling] about 10 meters above you. You can travel west and northeast into open areas or north into a gaping [lava] tube. A cool [breeze] flows from the west to the northeast.
This cavern features a change in rock type from molten to granite. You can feel a cool [breeze] coming from the northwest tunnel and flowing to the east. In the dim light, you can also see passages heading west and southwest.
The granite [walls] in this corridor are peppered with outcroppings of different [minerals]. The [minerals] protrude like jagged teeth from the cave's [walls] and you get chills down your spine as your glowing hands reflect off their surface. A gentle [breeze] flows from the west to the southeast.
There is barely enough room to breathe in this vertical chute. You see a few precarious handholds above you, leading up to a [narrow slit] in the ceiling. You can also drop down through a tight [crack] below you.
This area looks very familiar. You've managed to crawl up to the 5th [layer] section from which you and Jacob originally fell from. Directly beneath you, you can see the [narrow slit] you just crawled up. To your right you can see the [gaping hole] that you fell through several hours earlier. Tunnels and chutes lead off in all directions.
This room is generally quite a bit bigger than what you're used to underground. Towering [stalactites and stalagmites] look like imposing sentinels standing guard in the dim light. Passages can be seen to the north and south. Also of interest are the set of stone [steps] leading up to the west. These [steps] are completely symmetrical and were obviously created by a master craftsman. Could it be that other humans or humanoids have preceded you to this level of the underground?
You have entered a north-south passage covered from top to bottom with soft [spongy moss]. This room seems much more humid than the other places you've been to, but still maintains a cool room temperature. The floor of this cavern is covered with a thick layer of [dirt] and you leave light [tracks] on it as you walk across it. Strangely, you can also smell the faint trace of... cleaning solvent? Disinfectant? You're not too sure.
You find yourself in what appears to be a cramped [closet] that was once used to store things. It's almost completely barren.
This is a rather ordinary room with common geological structures such as [stalagmites], [stalactites], [columns], etc. [Droplets of water] can be seen dripping to the floor from the cave's roof.
The passage is quite tight here. You wish now that you hadn't eaten so much in the weeks preceding the expedition. A [narrow crack] opens to the west and a larger opening heads east. You can feel a cool [breeze] coming from the west.
In the centre of this room sits a perfectly round [hole] with [vapor] slowly sifting from it. A large [shaft], the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the [ceiling]. The [vapor] from the [hole] slowly trickles up a [porous, cratered wall] to the west and finally up through the [shaft]. The ground here trembles softly.
You are hanging off the [wall] at the [base] of a huge [shaft]. An active geyser can be seen directly beneath you, and darkness leads up above you.
You can no longer see the ground beneath you. The [wall] you are clinging to is still climbable although you're not sure for how long.
You've gone up about as far as you can go. The handholds above you are few and far between. In the dim light you survey your surroundings. [Mineral veins] run through the rugged rock face, and a small [ledge] is visible just east of your position.
You're in what looks like a [quarry] for the various kinds of ore found in this area. There must have been some sort of civilization or group of workers living down here at one point, because you notice the remains of [firepits] and pieces of [refuse] scattered around the site.
The temperature in this room is considerably cooler than what you're used to in the underground. In fact there is a [frosty film] covering most of the [rocks] in this area. What's really interesting, however, is the HUGE [glacier]-like [block of ice] filling up the entire south end of the cave!
You're in a tight [crawl space] completely made of [ice]. You thank the gods you're not claustrophobic or you'd have real problems right now. Passages lead to the north and southeast.
You're in a room covered from top to bottom with [ice and snow]. The room temperature here is obviously below zero and you can see your own breath as you tremble across the frozen landscape. A tight passage leads northwest, and another smaller cavern can be seen to the south.
This must be the White Dragon's private storage area. [Gold, silver] and other [precious metals] can be seen lying around in abundance.
This small alcove has at least ten different types of [fungi] growing from the [walls].
You vaguely recognize your surroundings as the Great Hall in the [Druids'] Temple; however the [colors] and dimensions seem somewhat distorted. You are surrounded by a [hazy mist] on all sides.
You have entered a cavernous room made up of a dark rock that you don't recognize. The room continues east into a field of [strange fossilized] [outcroppings] and southwest into another open area. A slight [breeze] blows towards the field to the east.
You're surrounded on all sides by a vast expanse of [crags, craters and crevasses]. "Growing" from the rugged terrain are thousands of [gypsum flowers], forming a mass of spiny pseudo-claws, reaching out for the [air] above. It's tough to tell which way is which in this enormous uncharted landscape. You can still feel that slight [breeze], but you can't really tell which way it's blowing anymore.
The gypsum flower garden ends in this [tiny], dark alcove. To the east stands a huge [door] made of a black stone that you don't recognize. It's about 15 feet tall, and has a huge [lock] on its face. The gypsum gardens can be seen back to the west and you can feel a slight breeze blowing east toward the [door].
You're in a huge [black] cavern. High atop the [walls], [torches] keep the room well lit. The floor here is made of polished stone, which is quite uncommon in the underground. The room is quite tidy and you marvel at the fact that there isn't any dust! A passage leads off to the east and a rocky [ramp] leads up to the southeast.
You've scrambled up onto the apex of the ramp. Unfortunately it's a dead end, and the only means of escape is back down the ramp. Huge [boulders] sit precariously on this ledge. Through the [boulders] you can see the [Black Dragon], nursing his severed arm, and looking up at you while plotting his next move.
Your eyes [bug] out as you enter this room. There's [gold] to the right of you, [silver] to the left, and all sorts of unimaginable [treasures] just waiting to be discovered.
This is it: the final confrontation. You find yourself in a hollowed-out piece of pure magma. The [air] smells of sulfur dioxide and you cough lightly as you breathe it in. A [river of lava] can be seen through a gap to the south and a [river of water] flows to the north. A narrow strip of land divides the two [rivers] as the room continues west to a [plateau] over which a [wooden chandelier] hangs.
You are midway between the entrance to this cave and the [plateau] that the [Red Dragon] currently sits on. To the south flows a [river of lava], while to the north flows a [river of water]. To the east you see the [Black Dragon] limping in anticipation and to the west you see the mighty [Red Dragon] sitting under her [chandelier], looking increasingly agitated.
A huge piece of molten rock juts out here, forming the plateau that the [Red Dragon] usually lies on. A [river of lava] can be seen to the south and a [river of water] to the north. High up above the plateau hangs a beautiful [wooden chandelier].
You're bobbing up and down like a buoy in the ocean, subject to the whim of the strong [river] current. The [water] is surprisingly cold, but fortunately you have your [air bladder] to keep you afloat.
You're bobbing up and down in a [river of cold black water]. Even your [glowing hands] don't light up the area as much as you'd like. The current is still pulling you west and the [water] feels even [colder] than before.
This [small beach] is made up of tiny [pebbles] from all sorts of different [rocks and minerals]. The raging [river] heads south and a shining [light] can be seen coming from a [small] passage to the north.
Intricate [tiles and tall marble columns] form the base of this magnificent room. The ceiling is high and arched and is cut from the same stone that the cavern is made of. [Wooden lattices] and beautifully painted [murals] line every [wall and light] radiates from an undetermined source.
The [console] room is the heart of operations of the TARDIS. Dominating the room is a [[six]-side] [console]. Located above the [console] is the [scanner]. A corridor to the east leads further into the TARDIS. On the west side of the room are the [main doors].
This corridor, like almost all the corridors of the TARDIS, seems to stretch on forever. The console room lies to the west, and the corridor continues eastward into the distance. There's a closed [door] on the south wall.
This is the room where you do much of your tinkering with electronic gadgetry. Many a Rutan invasion or Dalek plot has been foiled by an ingenius invention you've thrown together at last minute in this room. In fitting with your work habits, it's usually a rather untidy place. However, in your latest fit of spring cleaning you've almost emptied the place out. There's a small [cupboard] on the eastern wall, and on the north wall an open [door] connects the workshop to the corridor outside.
You're standing on a relatively flat piece of ground on the side of a mountain. [Rocky] outgrowths stand like walls all around you. A trail through the [rock] is visible to the east, while another trail to the northwest leads farther up the mountain.
You stand before a huge pile of stone [rubble] and charred [debris]. You recognize this spot to be the site of Solon's castle. The castle appears to have been completely destroyed. You sense a slight psychic twinge in the air. This looks like the work of the Sisterhood.
You're at the bottom of a [cliff] that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above. A narrow cleft runs into the [cliff] base to the east.
You are standing before a large murky [lake] which stretches to the east as far as the eye can see. A steep slope leads northwards, and a trail winds its way through the rock to the west.
The trail ends here at a rather [small ledge] which overlooks a precipitous drop of about 30 feet. Be careful not to lose your footing here. Looking downwards, you are surprised to see what looks like a [flying saucer] parked below you. You can only safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.
You're standing on the top of a [small flying saucer]. It's difficult to keep your foothold here, as the [saucer] is constructed of smooth, shiny metal. The end of your [scarf] hangs down beside you from above. The surface of the [saucer] is unbroken and featureless except for what looks like a [small hatch].
You're in a large area fairly clear of rocks and debris. Unclimbable walls of rock surround this area, but a path does lead between the rock to the northwest. About thirty feet above you, a [ledge] is visible on the side of the mountain. A [long], multi-coloured [scarf] dangles over the side of the [ledge] above, just beyond your reach.
You're in a dark passage carved into the rock. A [tapestry] is drawn across the passage to the west. Dim light comes from underneath it. More light is visible to the north.
You stand in the middle of the Temple of the Sisterhood of Karn. The light here is very dim, with only a few [candles] providing light. A [throne] sits on a raised [dias] here. On one wall you see a hinged [metal shield], beneath which a large [golden] [chalice] sits upon a [small ledge]. There is a [tapestry] on the east wall, and a closed [wooden door] on the south wall. To the north, a passageway leads out of the Temple.
You seem to have reached a [small] plateau, which overlooks a [rocky] clearing far below. Below you can see the familiar blue shape of the TARDIS standing in the clearing. The [stoney] trail terminates here, leading back downwards to the west.
This room is very cramped, more like a large closet than a [small] room. The floor, walls and ceiling are constructed of a seamless [metal]. An open [archway] to the north leads out into a corridor.
You're standing in a cramped [metal] maintenance shaft which leads below the floor of the spaceship. There's not much space here, and you have to bend down a little to remain upright. The shaft stretches out to the northwest.
The shaft reaches a junction here, stretching out to the west, northeast and and southeast. There's not much space here, and you have to bend down a [little] to avoid hitting your head on the floor [plate] above you.
The corridor continues in a north-south direction. There's a [small] room to the west.
The corridor continues in a north-south direction here. On the eastern wall you can see a [large round metal door], with a [metal wheel] on its center. The [door] is closed. On one side of this [door] there is a [large lever] and a button. A [glass bubble] above the [door] glows green.
The docking [bay] is a cavernous chamber constructed of seamless [metal]. The east wall is dominated by the bulky [bay [doors]], which are tightly sealed shut at the moment. There is an open [door] on the west wall through which a corridor is visible.
This [small] room appears to have no [lighting]. There's a closed [door] on the east wall. The only [light] originates from two [screens] side by side on the north wall. Below each [screen] is a single [button].
The corridor makes a sharp bend here, leading south and east. An open [door] leads to the west.
This room is dominated by a [large anti-matter] [reactor] which supplies power to most of the ship. Beside the [reactor], you can see a [control bank].
This room is a prison cell. Actually, prison cubicle is a better name for it. The room is [tiny], has a low ceiling and is devoid of any furniture. Cybermen don't pay much heed to the comfort of their prisoners. The only object that seems to be part of this room is a [round plastic device] on the ceiling.
This appears to be the flight deck of the spacecraft. The north wall consists mostly of a large [viewscreen] before which sits a complex [control panel]. A rather uncomfortable-looking [metal chair] sits before the [control panel].
There's a distinctly eerie atmosphere to this [small] chamber. On the far side of the room you can see what looks like a [raised] dias, or [platform].
This is the [entrance] to the library. The [circulation] [desk] dominates the room, seemingly cobbled together over the course of several generations from an assortment of [desks] and tables. A pair of [security gates] stands before the front [doors] to prevent people from stealing books. A [card catalog] lurks in a dark and dusty corner of the room, seemingly cringing away from the harsh flourescent [light]. Glass [doors] to the west lead to the book stacks; an archway to the northwest is labelled "Duplicating Services"; a [door] to the north bears a [sign] marked "[Private]" in large friendly letters; and the exit is to the east
This cavernous room is lit with flickering [flourescent] [lighting] which makes the [ceiling] look even lower than it really is. It is filled with half-empty [shelves], upon which rest the dusty [boxes] of many early [games]. To one side sits a massive, ancient [desk], its surface cluttered with [paperwork]. A [sign] on the [wall] indicates that this is the [reference] [desk], which would make the prim young [woman] sitting behind it the [reference] [librarian]. A doorway to the north is labelled "Stairs", and glass [doors] lead east to the lobby.
Grungy [stairs] lead upwards, to the second level. A [damaged picture] hangs on the [wall]. The door to the ground floor shelving area is to the south.
Grungy [stairs] lead downwards. The lights are dim, and a [painting] hangs on the [wall]. A door to the south appears to open into a room of shelves.
This cavernous room is filled with [shelves] as far as the eye can see. A [doorway] to the east is labelled "Computer Room", and the stairwell lies to the north.
The shelves are nearly bare, although there is a complete set of the "[New Zork Times]", a box labeled "[Avalon]", and several [biographies] of [various computer game authors]. The door out is to the north
This entire room hums with the combined output of several dozen [computers]. All of them are hopelessly out of date, but at least they're still good for word processing.
The ramshackle [wooden] [fence] in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that [egg] isn't careful...
The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north-south [passage] winds through the [forest] here; [trees] and gnarled [undergrowth] [barricade] all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the [ground] and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
Wet [branches] slap your face, their icy [needles] stinging. Dense [underbrush] creeps in from all [sides]. With each step, [mud] oozes into your shoes. [Insects] drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough [bark]. The [path] hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the [trees] like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.
The footpath snaking down from the northeastern [forest] has widened here into a country [lane]. [Gravel] crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the [sun]. Some distance to the west, a few small [cottages] flock together like children telling secrets. [Smoke] curls from the [chimney] of the [cottage] nearest to you. Beyond the [village], further west, a [clock tower] rises above the surrounding [roofs].
Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy [garden] snuggles against the [stone cottage] to the south. [Ivy] frames the whitewashed front [door]; starched white [curtains] hang in a [diamond-paned] [window]. A faint [path] forks southeast and southwest around the [cottage], toward the back. To the north, across the [lane] that runs through the [village], a few small [cottages] line the [road]. The [clock tower] looms further west, silhouetted against the [sky].
A cheery [pink] [bungalow] with [gingerbread] [trim] and a yellow painted [door] nestles behind the [picket fence] to the south. [Grass] covers the [yard] from corner to corner, except at the edges, where [flowers] dance with the [fence]. Circling the [bungalow] to the southeast and southwest, a faint [path] leads around the back. To the north, a few small [homes] peer across the [lane], which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the [village]. The [clock tower] dominates the [skyline] to the west.
[Grass] surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A [ribbon] of flattened [grass] curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the [bungalow], branching northeast and northwest. A [grass]-covered [hill] to the southwest shimmers under the [sun's] heat; waves of green-gold [grass] ripple toward the crest of the [hill], racing the wind to the top.
Grass sweeps up the [hill] like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see everything from up here: the [forest], the village, even the [fence] where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its [clock] tower lie to the northwest.
Both the [playground] and its adjacent [schoolhouse] to the south lie vacant and deserted. The bare, hard-packed [rectangle of earth], despite a few faint [chalk marks], shows no evidence that children may have once played here--or might ever play here again.
The abandoned [schoolroom] lacks not only pupils, but also books and pencils and chalk and paper and any other hint that someone might show up for school tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next. Rows of empty [desks and chairs] face the teacher's [desk] at the front of the room as if waiting expectantly for the day's lesson. The [door] to the north leads back out to the empty [schoolyard]. [Stairs] to the south lead up into darkness.
Dimly lit [stairs] lead back down into the schoolroom. Before you, a heavy, solid [door] stands firmly closed.
Dim, greenish [light] from above reflects off an assortment of large [brass gears] mounted flat against a stone [wall] on the far side of the room. Taut [cables] run upward through a network of [pulleys], vanishing into the gloom more than twenty feet above your head. The entire [mechanism] turns and meshes in a slow, rhythmic, hypnotic [clockwork] dance.
It [night] time, and [Grunk] see [moon] up in [sky]. There [forest] to east and north. It even darker there, and [Grunk] hear lots of [strange animal]. West of [Grunk], there [big field] with [little stone wall]. [Farm] back to south.
[Grunk] at bottom of deep, [dark hole]. It even smell like deep, [dark hole]. There some [light] that come from [tunnel] to east; that how [Grunk] see where [Grunk] at. Look like there maybe [stairs] at west side of [hole] that go up to [outside], but them all [broken] now. There [big crack] in [ground] near [stairs], too.
All [wall] in this [room] glow. It [bright], just like day time. Except that instead of [sun], it [wall] that glow. And instead of [grass and tree], it square [room] with four [wall]. And instead of [outside], it all under [ground]. But beside those thing, it just like it! [Tunnel] keep going [out] to east and west, but normal [doorway] go north and southeast and southwest.
This [room] have two [big picture] that [face] each other. West [wall] have [picture] on it and east [wall] have different [picture] on it. [Grunk] think both [picture] really just part of [wall], though. South [wall] have [doorway] in it that lots of light come from and north [wall] not have anything in it at all.
This [room] look like it maybe for eating or for play [cards] or for maybe for just sitting and talking. That because there big [table] and one [chair] here. There no lamp or thing like that in [room], but lots of [light] come from northeast [doorway]. Other [doorway] go east.
It [dark]. [Grunk] see lots of [shadow]. [Grunk] see [doorway] to east and west, too. But mostly [shadow].
There lots of [shelfs] in this [room]. Them on every [wall]. This [room] probably have lots and lots of [thing] in it before. But [shelfs] all empty now. [Grunk] not see any [thing] there at all. Maybe [Grunk] see more if [Grunk] have [torch] that on fire. But probably not, because lots of [light] come from northwest [doorway]. There [doorway] to west too.
[Grunk] not see any [thing] there but [book] on [top] shelf.
[Tunnel] come to little [cave] here, but [wide stream] block way east. [Grunk] not see much on other [side]. Not know if [tunnel] keep going or stop here. Only [light] that [Grunk] see come from bright [room, far] off to west. But [Grunk] hear lots of [water].
[Grunk] glad that [door] open. This place pretty [dark]. It even more [dark] in [tunnel] that go north. Seem like there lots of [dark] place around here. Maybe that because [Grunk] under [ground]. There more light on other side of open [door], though.
There tunnel here that go all different way. It all very twisty and confusing. Not even sure what way [Grunk] come from.
This really tricky place. It all twisty and dark. Think even [pig] confused.
There still lots of different tunnel here that go every way [Grunk] can see. Not really know where [Grunk] at, but [Grunk] think gnome know, and that good enough for [Grunk].
You are standing outside a medium sized, new-looking [office] block. Blue [glass] rises majestically above you, and off to the east and west. To your north is the main entrance. To the south is the main carpark.
You're standing in the south east corner of the [carpark].
You are sitting inside your [car]. It smells a bit.
You are standing to the east of the [office building's] facia. There are thick [bushes] to the south and a gravel path leads east to west.
You are in a damp corner where the front of the [office building] meets a low brick [building], with no windows, which runs south.
The low building is a storage shed of some kind. You can enter the door to the east, or continue down the pathway which leads north to south down the edge of the building. Dense [bushes] lie to the west.
At the end of the path lies a clearing in the [bushes], containing an old abandoned [well], covered in [wild plants]. You estimate it to be about 5 meters deep and about a meter in diameter. There are [footprints] in the dirt next to the [well] - someone has been here recently. The path leads north, between thick [bushes].
You are lodged at the bottom of the [well], your feet against one side and your back against the other. You can't help but think these stains will never come out. Yuck. Below you is a few inches of [murky water].
You are concealed in a thick clump of [bushes]. The office building is barely visible to the north.
Secluded by thick [bushes], you are standing at the top of a stone stairwell, set into the floor. It smells of damp, and moss grows on the steps.
You are in a concrete room with a low ceiling. Thick black cables run from ducts in the walls. There is a [small yellow label] on the duct. A low tunnel leads south west.
The [main entrance] to the [building] is plush and opulent. And locked. The lights are off and the [doors] are securely locked. Through the toughened [glass] you can see a half finished cup of coffee (or perhaps tea - no accounting for taste) sitting on the receptionists desk. It looks like someone left in a hurry.
You are standing to the west of the [office building's] facia. Thick [bushes] block your way to the south and a gravel path leads east to west.
The bikeshed is big and [dusty]. Nobody actually rides a bike to work - that would be madness - but they have a bikeshed anyway. You suspect that employees come out here to smoke. Bushes block your passage to the south - the only path leads east.
A large [gate] blocks the delivery bay to the west. There is some sort of [control panel] mounted by the side of the [gate]. The carpark lies to the east.
The storeroom contains lots of huge [boxes] on palettes, wrapped in industrial strength [clingfilm]. To the south is the delivery bay. A door leads north, into the building.
You are standing in a well-lit room with a huge vault [door] in it. It is currently closed, blocking the way north. There is a small [keypad] to the side of the vault [door]. [Doors] lead south and east.
The kitchen a spacious and hi-tech. Reminds you of Dotcom-era extravegance. There are alot of [cupboards], topped by a [marble counter]. Doors lead east and south.
A door to the south leads into the garden. A [water cooler] sits invitingly in the corner. More doors lead east and west.
The garden is beautiful - hundreds of bright [flowers], big tall [trees] and a HUGE [paper tree] in the center. A door to the north leads into the building, which encloses the garden to the west. The garden continues south and east.
You are sitting up in the branches of a giant [paper tree]. The only way from here is back down the way you came.
You are in a [dusty] shed in the corner of the central garden. Doors lead north and west.
The garden is beautiful - hundreds of bright [flowers], big tall [trees] and a massive marble [fountain] in the center. A door to the south leads back into the building, which encloses the garden to the west. The garden continues north, with a shed to the east.
The [copier] room doesn't contain any windows, and vibrates slightly with fluorescent [light]. A big [copier] sits quietly in the corner.
You are standing in the stationary cupboard. [Wooden shelves] stretch high above you. Doors lead south and west.
It was a dangerous climb, but you're now on the top [shelf] of the stationary cupboard. The only way is down.
A generic office. [Desks and chairs] are scattered around. Each desk has a [computer] on it. Doors lead north and south.
You are in a very [long] east-west corridor. A door leads north.
You are at the east end of a very [long] east-west corridor. A door leads south.
You are cramped into a small [security] office. The only exit is the door to the north.
You are standing in the opulent [reception] lobby. A [doorway] leads north into the corridor. The [main door] lies to the south. The huge [receptionist's] [desk] takes up about half of the room.
A carpeted [stairwell], with wide [steps] leading upwards. A corridor lies to the south.
A carpeted [stairwell], with wide [steps] leading both up and down.
The landing is a wide open space just beyond the stairwell (which lies to the north). You can see the [carpark] through the huge [glass wall] to the south. A door leads east.
This area is evidently some sort of project space - there are several [chairs] scattered around, with a big [whiteboard] on the south wall. A [window] to the north looks down into the [garden].
You are in a short hallway running east to west. You can see the [garden] through a [window] in the north wall.
You are standing in a corner office. It's quite plain, with a [computer, desk and chair].
You are standing in a waiting room, ouside the board room to the north. A [water cooler] lies in wait for thirsty visitors.
You are standing in a grand board room. A [long oval table] occupies most of the space, surrounded by high-backed [chairs]. A [large plasma screen] hangs on the wall.
The whole rooms seems to revolve around a large [card punching machine] in the center. Doors lead west and south.
As with all good "new economy" companies, Ludicorp has devoted a room entirely to storing [chocolate].
You are in a small clean bathroom. [Cubicles] line the wall.
You are in a small printing room. A large [printer] stands against the wall.
You are standing at the bottom of a vast, black [tower], which hums and throbs with hidden power. A door is visible about ten metres above you. A ladder leans against it, allowing you to climb to the door.
You are standing at the [top] of the [ladder], facing a door to your west, which leads into the tower.
You are standing is what must be a lobby - it's a large circular room, the full cross section of the tower (allowing for the foot-thick walls. The room is entirely empty. To your east, a door leads out of the tower. A [ladder] leads upwards.
You are now in the tower's central control room. [Papers] lay scattered about in a haphazard fashion. A [door] to the north is locked. It seems like a fairly [sturdy iron door]. A [ladder] leads down into the lobby.
A large [window] to the south offers a stunning view.
You are standing in a small, curved, corner room, looking out across the [city]. Doors lead north and east.
The stockroom contains stacks of old [boxes] piled along the walls.
You are in some kind of [waste disposal] room. A large, scary-looking [machine] stands against the north wall.
You are in what is probably a company [games] room. An old [arcade game] sits on the north wall, next to a [window] overlooking the [garden]. A [pool table] takes the centre of the room. Door lead east and west, with a balcony to the south.
The balcony is a simple concrete construction, towering over the entrance below. It's a [long] way down. You shiver slightly as a cold breeze blows past you.
A wide room with [round table] surrounded by [chairs]. A [window] to the south shows a good [view] of the [carpark], while the northern [window] has a great [view] of the [garden].
You're in a plush ante-room, with a [water cooler] in the corner. You suspect the door to the north leads to some important places. Another door leads west to the meeting room.
You're in a [small] maintainence room, with doors leading north and south. A [huge duct] runs along one wall, with a [small pipe] above it.
You are standing in the Eric Control Centre, a [long], narrow room, with a [huge console] down the east wall. [Operator chairs] sit in front of the [console] nonchalantly. A [window] to the west provides a nice [view] of the [garden].
The server-room throbs with power. [Rack] after [rack] of expensive looking [servers] are lined up along the walls. A door leads south and the room continues to the west.
The room continues to the east. To the west is the [outer door] for an airlock. It is currently closed.
The airlock is small and [white]. The [inner door] (closed) lies to the west and the [outer door] (open) to the east. There is a small creditcard sized [slot] next to the [inner door].
A carpeted [stairwell], with wide [steps] leading downwards. A door onto the roof lies to the west.
You are standing on top of the office building on the east side. You can continue round the roof to the north west and south west. All water on the roof funnels to this side and runs down a small [drain] set in the floor.
A [giant], angry [robot] blocks your way to the south. The airlock lies east with it's [inner door] open.
This is a large [room] crammed with [computer] [terminals], small [computers], and printers. An exit leads south. [Banners], [posters, and signs] festoon the [walls]. Most of the tables are covered with waste [paper], old pizza [boxes], and empty Coke cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.
This is the second floor of the Computer Center. An [elevator] and call [buttons] are on the south side of the hallway. A large, noisy [room] is to the north. Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the west a corridor leads into a smaller [room].
This is a [place]. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh [sounds] split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.
You are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock [platform].
You stand before a low rock [platform], more like an afterthought of [piled] [rocks] or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the [pile] by the crowd around you.
This is a battered, [rather] [dirty] [elevator]. The fake wood [walls] are scratched and marred with [graffiti]. The [elevator] [doors] are open. To the right of the [doors] is an area with floor [buttons] (B and 1 through 3), an open [button], a close [button], a stop [switch], and an alarm [button]. Below these is an access [panel] which is closed.
This is the lobby of the Computer Center. An [elevator] and call [buttons] are to the south.
Bare concrete [walls] line a wide corridor leading east and west. An [elevator] and call [button] are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor to [ceiling] run [wire channels] and steam [pipes].
During the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still around. This is the [basement] of one of them. The [basement] extends west, a stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.
This [basement] level [room] is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent [lights] cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the [basement] area continues.
This is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and a [corridor] [heads] south towards the main building.
The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set of [doors] leads west into the howling blizzard.
The corridor extends both ways from here. [Many] closed and locked [offices] are to the north and south.
A stairway leads up, and a [door] leads out to the Great Court.
Here a walkway circles the base of a huge ornate dome. Below is the Infinite Corridor. From stories of Tech Exploring trips, you recall that there is supposed to be a ladder here. On the other hand, there is a shiny [rope]-like thing hanging near where the ladder used to be, and leading upward. Below you, in the corridor, you can see a floor [waxer], busily waxing the floor.
Inside the great dome, near the top, a metal [catwalk] is precariously perched. There is no way further up, but a small metal [door] is set in the [side] of the dome.
You are perched precariously on the [roof] of the Great [Dome]. A set of narrow indentations in the [dome] provides a dangerous route to the very tip-top of the [dome].
This is the very top of the Great Dome, a favorite [place] for Tech fraternities to install cows, Volkswagen Beetles, giant birthday candles, and other bizarre [objects]. The top is flat, round, and about five feet in diameter. It's very windy, which has kept the [snow] from accumulating here. The only way off is down.
This is the east end. The [corridor] branches north and south here.
This cluttered passage leads southeast. It is full of apparently discarded electronic [equipment], old rusty file [cabinets], and other [detritus]. A stairway also leads up.
This is a cluttered [basement] below the Brown Building. Discarded [equipment] nearly blocks an already narrow hallway that terminates in a stairway leading up. The passage itself continues northwest.
This is the lobby of the Brown Building, an eighteen-story skyscraper which houses the Meteorology Department and other outposts of the Earth Sciences. The [elevator] is out of order, but a long stairway leads up to the [roof], and another leads down to the [basement]. A revolving [door] leads out into the night.
This is the top of the stairway. A [door] leads out to the [roof] here, and you can hear the wind blowing beyond. There is a [sign] on the [door].
A low parapet surrounds a small [roof] here. The [air] conditioning cooling tower and the small protrusion containing the stairs are dwarfed by a semitransparent [dome] which towers above you. The blowing [snow] obscures all detail of the city across the river to the south.
You are inside a large [domed] area. The [dome] contains [equipment] that makes it clear it is a weather observation station. For some reason, it also contains a small peach [tree]. Wind whistles outside, and [snow] blasts against the semitransparent material of the [dome].
This courtyard is a triumph of modern architecture. It is spare, [cold], angular, overwhelming in size, and bears a striking resemblance to a wind [tunnel] whenever the breeze picks up. Right now this is true of the whole campus, though. A huge [mass] lurks nearby, and an almost featureless skyscraper is to the north.
What's deader than dead storage? That's what's in this [room]. Most of the contents have collapsed or rusted back to the primordial ooze. There is mold growing on some of the unidentifiable [piles]. Stagnant [puddles of water] pollute the floor. You can now believe how old some of these foundations are said to be.
This is an ancient tunnel constructed of roughly mortared [bricks and stones]. A slippery and almost invisible set of [handholds] leads up. The tunnel continues a long way north and south from here.
You are in a huge, cave-like construction. A path leads down to a floor partly covered with rough concrete. The [walls and ceiling] are high and reinforced with beams of wood, iron, and steel. In the center of the floor you can see a large, flat [slab] of granite. The only exit is behind you to the south.
You are at the bottom of the cave. The huge [slab] of granite in the center is a sort of [altar]. It is carved with strange and disturbing [symbols], the largest of which looks very familiar. Some of the [symbols] are obscured by rusty red stains. Nearby is an iron [plate] set in the concrete of the floor.
This is a storage [room]. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded [junk]. Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of [junk] stops and the next begins. It's [piled] to the [ceiling] on ancient, rotting [pallets]. A narrow path winds eastward through the [junk].
This corridor is lined with closed, dark [offices]. At the south end of the corridor is a [door] with a [light] shining behind it. There is something written on the [door].
This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed [door] to the north leads back into the [corridor] and an [archway] opens to the south.
The [lab] is an ultramodern, fully equipped chemistry [lab]. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, you aren't a chemistry major, so the equipment might as well be magical.
This is the subbasement of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. A stairway leads up. A narrow crack in the northwest corner of the [room] opens into a larger space.
This is a tiny, narrow, ill-fitting [room]. It appears to have been a left over space from the joining of two preexisting buildings. It is roughly coffin [shaped]. The [walls] are covered by decades of overlaid [graffiti], but there is one which is painted in huge fluorescent [letters] that were apparently impossible for later artists to completely deface. On the floor is a rusty access [hatch locked] with a huge [padlock].
This dank and grimy [tunnel] is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam [pipe]. The [tunnel] is uncomfortably hot and damp. You have gone from the arctic to the tropics. The concrete [tunnel] has odd molds and fungi growing on its [walls and ceiling], and the floor is squishy. Torn clots of insulation litter the floor. Along the [ceiling] runs a thick tangle of coaxial [cable]. The [tunnel heads] east and west. A rusty metal [ladder] leads up.
A thick bundle of coaxial [cable] runs east to west along the [ceiling]. There is a pressure release [valve] on the steam [pipe] here.
The steam tunnel is narrow here, and its construction is more archaic. It's now mostly brick, although the floor is concrete. The steam [pipe] and coaxial [cable] continue along their appointed paths. The tunnel is damp and even a little muddy.
The steam [pipe] and coaxial [cable] turn upwards and disappear into the [ceiling] here. The tunnel itself comes to an end in a grimy, damp, and dripping triad of crumbling [brick walls]. The south wall looks particularly decrepit.
This small [room] is pretty bare and featureless. The north wall is [brick] and the other three [walls] are concrete. The east and west [walls] are adorned with [rails] not unlike railroad [rails]. Above you and out of reach, the [shaft] is blocked by something.
A bundle of coaxial [cable] runs along the [ceiling], festooned with damp mold and cobwebs. The tunnel continues west.
The tunnel continues west from here, becoming narrow, muddy, and forbidding. The [walls] no longer seem to be as finished as they were. The steam pipe and coaxial [cable] disappear into the [ceiling] at this point. The temperature has dropped considerably, as well.
This is a wide spot in the [tunnel], just as wet and muddy as elsewhere. The [walls] are slimy as well. Numerous [slots] or indentations about two [feet] wide and a [foot] high open here and there. Thin, [wire] or [ropelike] [growths] emerge from a [hole] further down and enter each of the [slots]. There is background [noise] here, almost loud enough to hear clearly.
You are lost in narrow, wet tunnels burrowed through the mud. Muddy, oily [water] covers the floor. A [curtain] of moldy [slime] covers the south [wall].
The floor here is a stagnant, slime infested [pool of water]. It feels to be about six inches deep. Ropes or wires tumble down the slope, where they enter a large whitish [mass] which takes up much of the [chamber]. The [noise] is loud here, and comes from the [mass], which undulates in synchrony with the [noise]. Wan, sourceless [light] illuminates the [chamber].
Moonlight diffuses through the [walls], tracing out unreadable [sigils] in [calligraphies of light and dark]. [Stairs] adorned with [bas-relief] motifs spiral downward.
Curiously, the only [weapons] here live amid [light] and cannot be worn: they are [silhouettes] flung against the [walls]. [Stairs] carved with [bas-reliefs] spiral upward.
Barren branches and [pines] suggest winter's quiet. [Metal and wood, painted and sculpted], the false [garden] is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.
It seems this is a [banquet] room, if a [banquet] had no especial place for people to dine. [Glassware and stoneware] are arranged in deliberate [shapes], as though they are [constellations].
Hawks [painted] in [gold and brown] soar along the [walls]. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.
Cherry blossoms and lilacs, [kite]-flying auguries and newly-budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the [kite] is a [red] speck dancing in the [storm]. The [moonlit] [tower] lays open beneath you, as though [stones] were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. [Lightning and storm clouds] gather around you, and in the [sky] above the [Moon] gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.
The south-north path ends at a newly-built brick wall which blocks your way. There are two [ogres] here, dressed as bricklayers, resting from their labours
proceed further as there is a very high wall to the north. There is an antique [shawm] here
paths to the north, west and northwest. There is a large iron [key] here
with exits to the east and west. Most of the apparatus is safely stored where you can't get at it, but there is a [bed] in the centre on which is lying a huge inanimate human body (or a mixture of several) with electrodes fastened to various parts of its anatomy. There seems to be no way of activating the [corpse]
size of a large human being, to the east and west. There is also a low crawl to the south. There is an ornately fashioned [bowl] of solid [gold] here
slime. The only exit is a low crawl north. A loathsome [toad] is crawling about here
your south and the platform extends east and west. You can hear the sounds of passengers although you can see nobody. There is a pile of sparkling [peridots] here
the north, south, east and west. There is a small [wax dummy] here
to your north. There is a large [centaur] here on guard duty
a cross between a stable and an office. There is a [flask] of expensive French [perfume] here
of steps down at this point. There is a [string] of shiny glass [beads] here
but the walls are unclimbable. A passage leads south. There is a small [ingot] here which, as you can see at a glance, is composed of the rare metal [Erbium]
and branches, exiting to the northeast, northwest, and up to the southeast. There is a [pigeon] waddling about here. There is a large blonde [wig] here
of your [lamp]: you can feel its warmth but cannot see it
it as an alternative universe, were it not for the word OOZELUMNY spelled out by the glowing air molecules. There is a [crust of bread] here
in the floor, into which all the light is plummetting. There is no other exit. There is a quantity of precious [myrrh] here
walls are decorated with numerous cabalistic symbols. The only exit is by an archway to the north. There is a pile of [millet] on the ground here
trees to your south. There is a priceless (and almost certainly unique) stuffed [dodo] here
and down from here and a passage to the south over which there is a notice, reading 'ONLY ONE VISIT ALLOWED'. A twenty-three stone [troll] is standing guard over the southern exit
There is a nasty little [goblin] chained to the wall here
sides. In the distance you can see various curious scenes, including a bridge over a chasm, a garden from which giant rocs are taking off, a large cornfield, a giant spider's web and a distant bungalow by the seaside. The path leads back downwards from these awe-inspiring sights. There is a wooden [staff] here
you will be taking an early bath once they've finished with the poor old [missionary]!
You're in a short east-west hall off the main hall. You can see an [elevator] here.
Boy, what a mess. [Buckets, pails, gigantic mops, dust cloths, brooms, cleaning solutions], etc. etc. etc., are scattered about with no semblance of order. It rather resembles your apartment (the level of organization, not the contents). You manage to squeeze into it. After a few moments of looking, you think you hear something on the other side of the south [wall].
You're at the north end of a long north/south hall, outside the [Physics Office]. You hear a faint [humming]. There are stairs to the west.
You are in a maze of twisty [little] passages, all alike.
You are in a small room, [lit] only by a bare 40-watt [light] bulb hanging from the [ceiling]. The floor is [littered] with [paper listings] and several [copies] of "[Spelunker Today]." On a [table] you see a very disreputable-looking IBM PC [clone]... and the missing Owlet-Picker V [printer]!
You are standing in a [large clearing] surrounded by a [dense forest]. There is a path to the east.
The path branches here. There are [paths] to the west and south that continue into the [forest]. The path to the east appears to lead into some rather [rocky territory].
This is the entrance to a canyon formed by an [ancient] river. The canyon is to the east. There is a [sandy] path to the northwest that seems to lead to a beach. There is a path leading into a forest to the west.
The path here is a [riverbed] that has long since gone dry. The river has cut [several meandering] passages into the canyon, forming what looks like two rather large [boulders]. A passage to the north appears to go around the [larger boulder], while a narrow [gap] to the southeast seems to go around the [smaller boulder]. A passage to the east cuts the [rock] into its separate sections. And of course, the passage to the west goes back the way you came.
This clearing is apparently a brief [widening] of some [ancient] river. There are various [small passages] winding around two [large boulders]. These are to the north, south, and west.
This is a beach that seems to stretch on forever to the east and west. There is nothing particularly notable about the beach, except that it has [white sand]. The ocean is to the north. You see an island on the horizon. There is a path winding across the [dunes] to the southeast.
The [water] is a bit deep, but with the snorkel on you can breathe. The shore is to the south. The island looms ahead to the north.
This is the main section of the island. The [primary landmark] on the island is a [towering rock], which lies along the coast here. There is a path to the rest of the island to the north.
This is an area with particularly [soft] earth. There is a path back to the main section of the island to the south.
This is a cylindrical room. The [walls] are smooth and unclimbable. There are no prominent features in this room, except for a torch securely fastened to the [wall]. There appears to be no way out of this room.
This is a large room which has [corridors] leaving the room in four different directions:  northwest, northeast, west, and south.
This is a [small] cavern with [passages] to the southeast, southwest, and north.
This [passageway] is rather damp and twists in all directions. All of these are dead ends except for the passages to the north, northwest, southwest, and southeast.
This is a [damp cave] with [moist ground].
You have come across a [shimmering] lake. This is an [intersection] with [paths] to the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast.
This is an area south of the [majestic] lake. There are many exits here, such as northwest, northeast, southeast, and south.
There is a [cool draft] coming from the southeast. There are other exits to the southwest and northwest.
This is a COLD room filled with [ice]. [Slush] fills a [hole] in the center of the room.
This room smells of [steaming] rice. Some [song] is playing in the distance, and it is saying something about rice [patties]. Exits are to the northeast and north.
This somewhat non-descript room has a particularly [musty odor]. There are exits to the north and south.
This is a [tall chamber] with columns lining the door to the west.
In the center of the room is a [diamond cage].
This is a [slippery tunnel] which has exits to the north, northeast, and southeast.
This is a large room. The majority of the room is taken up by a [massive pipe organ]. Thousands upon thousands of [pipes] fill the room. The [organ] appears to be in a playable condition.
Vapors radiate from the spot where a [wall of ice] used to stand. There are [fragments] of the [wall] on the ground. The passage to the west is now reachable.
This is a ledge that towers above an abyss. There is a fog below, but you can see a [faint light].
This small [guest room] is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized [bed] taking up most of the [space]. Sprawled across it lies [Frank] in a deep slumber. A small [closet] is tucked into the corner next to the [dresser], and a miniature [space heater] rests at the foot of the [bed]. On the [dresser] is an [alarm clock]. The only exit is back east into the [living room].
Set in soft [wood paneling], the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A [couch] sits in front of a cherry [wood coffee table] with a view to their big [screen television]. There is a [jar of peanut butter], a [bowl of chips], a [stack of napkins] and a [remote control] on the [table]. A large [glass sliding door], leading [out] to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk [back] south to the living room, or west to the [kitchen].
The Fincher's [kitchen] is very modern, with gray marble [counters], a beautiful [stove, oven], and a rounded [island]. A sturdy [refrigerator] stands in the corner of the [room] next to a [dishwasher], each modern appliance deeply contrasted by the old fashioned [microwave] hanging above the [stove]. There is a [butter knife], a [toaster], a [bottle of cleaning fluid] and a [scrub brush] on the [kitchen] counter. The [living room] is to the south east, and the [den] is immediately to the east.
Rank certainly does have its privileges. When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment. Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your [chest and bunk] are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center.
If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow. The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the [bunks] lining both sides of this building are perfectly made. Every [locker] next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place. The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.
Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size. The [walls] rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty. You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight-forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi-circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.
This is a vast chamber lined floor to [ceiling] with [bookcases] filled to capacity with [books]. You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days. A cursory glance at some [bookshelves] reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics. A few large [tables] with [chairs] are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.
This once majestic room was where visitors would come to relax and meet with the formal lord of the castle in a somewhat informal atmosphere. Several large comfortable [couches] are scattered about, dusty and altogether squalid. Many large [tapestries] still hang on the [walls] but are horribly faded from age. Large open archways lead east and west while a huge fireplace dominates the center of the room against the northern [wall].
You are at the northern end of the main hall taking in the panorama of what was once a majestic area where perhaps treaties were signed, strategies laid and plans [foiled].
The Duke wasn't one to stand on ceremony therefore he took all his meals in this room. This large room allowed many servers to shuttle back and forth from the kitchen to the north without getting in anyone's way. Dominating the center of the room is a long, grand [table] lined with comfortable looking high-backed [chairs] while exquisite [paintings] dot the [walls].
Many death-dealing weapons of every type were stored here. Several tall racks probably held spears while shorter ones mounted against the [wall] stored various kinds of [swords]. Other [wall] mounts, also empty, give you no idea what sort of weapons may have been held by them. A large archway north is partially blocked by collapsed stones and rubble.
In times past the vast wealth of the Duke would be stored here. Alas, with the castle taken and the Duke gone so with [him] went his riches. As you remember your history lessons, you recall the genealogy of the Dukes of Bostwin and their love of collecting treasures. You could only imagine what vast treasures were contained in this room long ago.
Looking around this large room you are astonished to learn that someone gutted this entire floor. You are looking out on one, huge room. No other rooms, no [walls] of any kind apart from the ones enclosing this gigantic area just nothing but empty room as far as you can see.
This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a [gangway] leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape [pods]. The [pod bulkhead] is closed.
The [pod door] clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.
(You are in the safety web.) This is one of the Feinstein's primary escape [pods], for use in extreme emergencies. A [mass] of safety [webbing], large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the [pod]. The [controls] are entirely automated. The [bulkhead] leading out is closed. You feel the [pod] begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.
You have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small [structure] clings to the face of the cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class could probably climb up to it.
This is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff wall. Through the shattered [windows] which ring the outer wall you can see [ocean] to the horizon. A weathered metal [plaque] with barely readable lettering rests below the [windows]. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A steep [stairway], roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.
The middle of a long, steep [stairway] carved into the face of a cliff.
You are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the [castles] you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a [stairway] downward is visible to the south.
This is a wide, east-west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small [door] to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel [padlock] which is also closed.
This is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway is lined with a motorized [walkway] (no longer running) that was probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.
A north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working [walkway] from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit area.
This section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor structural damage. The walls are [cracked], and a jagged [crevice] crosses the floor. An opening leads east and the corridor heads north and south.
On a small [shelf] is a large, unopened tin can. It has a plain white label which reads "Spam and Egz." A heavy-duty extendable [ladder] is leaning against the rear wall.
The hallway, in fact the entire building, has been rent apart here, presumably by seismic upheaval. You can see the sky through the severed roof above, and the ground is thick with rubble. To the north is a gaping [rift], at least eight meters across and thirty meters deep. A wide doorway, labelled "Sistumz Moniturz," leads west.
The corridor ends here. Portals lead west, north, and east. Signs above these portals read, respectively, "Administraativ Awfisiz," "Tranzportaashun Suplii," and "Plan Ruum." To the south is a wide [rift], spanned by a metal [ladder], separating this area from the rest of the building.
You have entered a small office of some sort. A small [desk] faces the main doorway which lies to the east. Another exit leads west.
This is a large, plush office. The far wall is one large picture window, scratched but unbroken, offering a view of this installation and the [ocean] beyond. In front of the window is a wide wooden [desk]. The only exit is east.
Although the room is quite barren, an octagonally-shaped [canteen] is sitting on one of the benches.
This is the food production and [dispensary] area for the dining hall to the north. Of particular interest is a [machine] near the [door]. You should probably examine it more closely.
This is a wide, brightly lit lobby. A blue metal [door] to the north is closed and a larger red metal [door] to the south is also closed. Beside the blue [door] is a blue [button], and beside the red [door] is a red [button]. A corridor leads west. To the east is a small room about the size of a telephone booth.
You have entered a tiny room with a sliding [door] to the south which is open. A [control] [panel] contains an Up button, a Down button, and a narrow [slot].
This is a small, circular room. A sliding [door] leads north, and a spiral staircase heads upwards. Other exits lie to the northeast and southwest.
This is a small room with no windows. The sole exit is southwest. Two wide [consoles] fill either end of the room; thick [cables] lead up into the ceiling.
This room is probably some sort of [machine] shop filled with a variety of unusual [machines]. Doorways lead north, east, and west.
Only one [robot], about four feet high, looks even remotely close to being in working order.
This is a very long room lined with multi-tiered [bunks]. Flimsy [partitions] between the tiers may have provided a modicum of privacy. These spartan living quarters could have once housed many hundreds, but it seems quite deserted now. There are openings at the north and south ends of the room.
(You are in the [bed].)
You slowly sink into a deep and restful [sleep].
This is a wide, flat strip of concrete which continues westward. A large transport of some sort lies to the south, its open door beckoning you to enter. A faded sign on the wall reads "Shutul Platform -- Kalamontee Staashun". [Floyd] rushes into the room and [barrels] into you. "Oops, sorry," he says. "[Floyd] not looking at where he was going to."
The corridor bends here, leading east and southwest. A [doorway] opens to the northwest, and a narrow [stairway] leads down to the north. There is a multiple purpose robot here. Floyd produces a crayon from one of his compartments and scrawls his name on the wall.
Lying face down at the bottom of the [stairs] is a motionless [robot]. It appears to be damaged beyond repair.
Lying on one of the [beds] is a small red [spool]. On a low [shelf] is a translucent [bottle] with a small white [label]. At the bottom of the [bottle] is a small quantity of [medicine].
[Floyd], rummaging in a corner, finds something and [carries] it to the center of the room to examine it in the brighter [light]. It seems to be the [breast plate] of a [robot], along with some connected inner circuitry. The entire [piece] is bent and rusting. [Floyd] stares at it in complete silence. A moment later, he begins sobbing quietly, awkwardly excuses [himself], and runs out of the room. You look at the [breast plate], and notice the name "Lazarus" engraved on it.
This is a long room whose walls are covered with complicated [controls] and colored [lights]. Two of these [lights] are blinking. The first one reads "[Bedistur] Faalyur!" The other light reads "Kritikul diivurjins frum pland kors." In one corner is a large metal [cube] whose [lid] is closed.
You catch a glimpse of a small [object] nestled among the dust. Sitting on a wide [table] is a [machine] of sorts, consisting of a video [screen] and a [keyboard]. It is currently turned off.
The hallway ends here but continues back toward the west. [Doorways] lead north, south and east.
This is the heart of the Project's vast laboratory complex. There are exits to the west and southwest, and heavy metal [doors] to the northeast and southeast. A small [doorway] leads south.
[Floyd] says "[Floyd] going exploring. See you later." He glides out of the room.
Hanging on a [rack] is a pale blue lab [uniform]. Sewn onto its [pocket] is a non-descript [logo]. The odds and ends on the [shelves] include a small round [object], which closer inspection reveals to be a fresh laser [battery].
There is a [pile] of computer [output] here. Floyd notices a mouse scurrying by and tries to hide behind you.
The [door] at the western end of the bio-[lock] closes silently.
[Floyd] stands on his tiptoes and peers in the [window]. "Looks dangerous in there," says [Floyd]. "I don't think you should go inside." He peers in again. "We'll need [card] there to fix computer. Hmmm... I know! [Floyd] will get [card]. [Robots] are tough. Nothing can hurt [robots]. You open the [door], then [Floyd] will rush in. Then you close [door]. When [Floyd] knocks, open [door] again. Okay? Go!" [Floyd's] voice trembles slightly as he waits for you to open the [door].
This is a small room barely large enough for one person. Mounted on the wall is a small [slot], and next to it a [keyboard] with numeric keys.
You are standing on a square [plate] of heavy metal. Above your head, parallel to the [plate] beneath you, is an identical metal [plate]. To the east is a wide, metallic [strip].
You are standing on a section of the [strip] with a bottomless void stretching out on both [sides]. The [strip] continues to the north and south.
North of here, the filament ends at a huge featureless wall, presumably the [side] of some [micro]-component. To the east is a vacuu-sealed [micro-relay], sealed in transparent red plastic. You could probably see into the [micro-relay].
This is the office for storing [files] on Bio Lab experiments. A large and messy [desk] is surrounded by locked [files]. A small booth lies to the south. A closed [door] to the west is labelled "Biioo Lab". You realize with shock and horror that the only way out is through the mutant-infested Bio Lab.
A ferocious feral [creature], with a hairy shelled body and a whip-like tail snaps its enormous mandibles at you. A giant [plant], teeming with poisonous tentacles, is shuffling toward you on three leg-like stalks. Lurking nearby is a vicious-looking [creature] with slavering fangs. Squinting in the light, it eyes you hungrily. Rushing toward you is an ugly, deformed humanoid, bellowing in a guttural tongue. It brandishes a piece of lab equipment shaped somewhat like a battle axe. The air is filled with mist, which is affecting the [mutants]. They appear to be stunned and confused, but are slowly recovering.
The elevator closes as you leave it, and you find yourself in a small, chilly room. To the north, through a wide arch, is an enormous chamber lined from floor to ceiling with thousands of cryo-[units]. You can see similar chambers beyond, and your mind staggers at the thought of the millions of individuals asleep for countless centuries.
With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the [deck].
Out of the smoke staggers [Davis], tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a [pirate]. [Davis's] [eyes] gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his [lips] dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you. [Davis] leaps across the [deck] to your side, "Free me or she dies!" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, [Captain] [Jamison] draws his [rapier], pulls you free and stabs. [Davis] slumps into a bloody heap. Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other [ship], down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace. You remain confined to this [room], a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg-legged old [man] and eaten in silence. Of your [handsome] rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.
The [room] has a masculine [air], with ebony panelling, a large messy [table], and a rumpled [bed] (upon which you lie). A [curtain] masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the [sill] of the tall [window] looking aft. [Captain] [Jamison] is adjusting his [clothes].
"We have anchored off St. [Sinistra]," says [Captain] [Jamison], "and I must look like a guest at [Lafond's] dance tonight. I will find and free your [father], and then finally wreak my revenge on [Lafond]." He half draws his [rapier] from its scabbard.
You are on the landing of a steep [stairway] heading up and down. A large [cupboard] against the aft [wall] blocks the [doorway] to the captain's quarters.
Kicked into a far corner is a pile of [clothes].
This is a gloomy, damp [area] at the bottom of the Helena [Louise]. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep [stairs].
Behind a high [fence], decorated by a [sign], are stacked the [food and ammunition] supplies; [casks] of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with [kegs of gunpowder] and shot. A closed [gate] is the only way in. You gradually notice a familiar, worrying smell, sniff, and identify it as smoke. A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor -- inside the [cage] full of [ammunition].
Strewn about the floor are various [powders] and spills of malodorous [potions]. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting. A small [bottle] has been dropped nearby. A chipped piece of [mirror] sits propped on a shoulder-high timber. "I gotta let [Lafond] know 'e's comin'." [Crulley] stands on [deck] above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a [grate] in the [ceiling]. "First, I do in the mates aboard-[ship], with this and t'other mischief," he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. "Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har." He dives into the sea.
The [room] has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy [table], and a rumpled [bed]. A [curtain] masks the forward exit and air breezes in over the [ledge] aft.
You are clinging to a slimy [ladder], tied to a rail of the poop [deck] above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the [ship]. All [air] is driven out of you as the [ladder] slams into the stern. The [reefs] seem a little larger than you thought before.
Abaft the [wheel] sits a large [pyramid of casks], held in [place] by a heavy [rope]. [Cannon line] the [deck], aimed at open sea and the [island].
It is a deceptively quiet evening on the [ship], the [pirates] singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The [mainmast] casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the [hatch]. A tangled mass of [rigging] hangs down from the [mast], like [many] rope ladders woven together.
Two large [barrels] stand near the [stair] to the foredeck.
Imbedded in the [deck] is a [grated] [air hole] to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous [railing]. Odors of old grease and char waft from a little [shack] perched behind the [mast].
You can see a mooring [winch] here. Your [eyes] are drawn to a flicker of [light] off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, [moonlight] flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, "...mischief, har...[reefs]."
A [dagger] is driven into the wooden floorboards. An entirely bald [man] sits here, carving into his peg leg. With a heave and creak of timbers, the Helena [Louise] drifts a little way back towards the [island]. The tide has turned.
No torches are lit, or needed on this [moonlit] night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation [wheel]. [Men] move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred [door].
It seems that the [cask] contains a slab of [pork].
The [skiff] nods in the waves, its [oars] jerking around in the current.
Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the [cliff].
Music and voices float from the [veranda] to the north.
You are on a well-trampled lawn at the side of the [house], one low doorway leading in to the east. Gravelled paths lead north and south into the undergrowth.
[Lucy] stands talking to you. "I haven't found [Lafond's] [papers], I'm watched too closely. Tell [Dimsford] that I -- I'm scared, and I want him to come get me. Give this to him -- he'll recognize it." [Lucy] slides a garter down her leg and holds it out to you.
You are in a small clearing under the western side of the [house]. Heavy [vines] creep up the wall past a second floor [window], open to the night air. Southwest is an opening in the bushes.
Draped across the [bed] is a lovely cream colored watered silk [gown]. It looks about your size.
You stand in a carpeted hallway, leading east to a stair landing. [Rooms] lie north and south of you.
The [butler] stands near the entrance to the ballroom.
Nicholas looks quite rakish, in red velvet and white, his [rapier] flashing in the [light] of the [chandelier]. "What the devil are you doing here! [Lafond] is a dangerous [man] to play with!" [Jamison] smiles suddenly. "Why should I complain? You are quite safe, since no one expects you here. And you are looking lovely." The steps of the dance separate you a moment, as you twirl around and curtsey to another dancer. You glide back into the [captain's] arms.
One long [table] set across the north entrance indicates that supper was served here earlier. West of you is the ballroom.
The carpeted hallway turns from west to north here, extending into the east wing. A long [table] blocks the way south.
An expensive [hat] is hanging on a [knob].
Cool salt [air], blowing past a [torch] on a spiral [staircase] below you, ruffles your hair and circles south into the [library].
Flickering [torchlight] lights the bottom of a spiral [staircase]. A draft blows from the east; a passage leads south.
A [powder horn] hangs on a long [strap] from the [wall]. A canvas [cot] is shoved against a [wall]. Sitting on the [cot] is a large [key].
The [crocodile] lies half in the [pool], gazing at you, with baleful [eyes], jaws wide open. Dagger-sharp teeth glint in the torchlight.
A pair of [manacles] hangs from iron [chains] attached high on the [wall].
This short passage turns from east to north to stop abruptly at an iron [door].
Your [father] calmly stands nearby. You briefly explain the current situation to your [father]. "I knew Falcon would do his best to rescue me, once you were safe," he responds. "Now to rescue [Lucy] -- Nicholas will have told you about her. You get him while I get [Lucy], and the four of us will meet down at the [beach]. Just show me the way out of this maze, and we'll get started."
You stand in a carpeted hallway, leading west to a stair landing. To the north is an ornately carved [door]. From the south comes the impression of light and air.
[Lafond's] [bedroom] shows all the outpourings of his megalomania. Royal hues of purple and gold weigh down the hangings on the [bed] and the eastward [window], as if trying to smother the [moonbeam] shining in. [Lafond] is leering, [lip] curled. He has a green [goblet]. A lace-covered [table] crouches beside a wing-backed [chair] in one corner. Sitting on the [table] is a [flagon]. [Lafond] waits impatiently for you to drink.
Down on the dance floor the dancers are pressed in a wide circle around Nicholas and [Lafond]. [Cookie] stands anxiously in the door to the veranda, near your [father and Lucy]. A [chandelier] is held above the dance floor by a [rope and pulley] system, so that the servants can lower it to [light] and snuff its [candles]. Several feet of [rope] hang down from the [pulley], the excess tied around the [railing]. Nicholas and [Lafond] circle each other intently, the one breathing hard, the other casual, [sword] tips almost touching. [Jamison] has lost copious amounts of blood and is no match for [Lafond], cool and competent. You hear a duellist leap forward, and [swords] clash, parrying.
Steps lead south from this white marble [veranda] to a clipped lawn. To the north the wreckage left by the duel is visible in the ballroom.
You are [behind] the [counter] at "Mr. [Tasty's Pizza Parlor]". To the southwest is the rest of the restaurant.
You are standing in the middle of "Mr. [Tasty's Pizza Parlor]". The [counter] separating you from the back of the [parlor] stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.
You stand in the heart of [San Doppleton's] [main drag], the business district. The [street] goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a [pizza parlor], with a [sewer vent] nearby.
You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a [courthouse] to the south. The [street] runs east and west.
You are in a crowded [courthouse]. The street is off to the north.
You are in [downtown] San Doppleton. The [street] coming from the east ends at a three-story office building to the west.
To the east you can see an [office] door labelled "Gunther & Associates"; other than that, the [office doors] on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.
You are in a bustling [law office]. The east [wall] is dominated by a large [window].
To the east is a [door] labelled "John Winnick, Mayor of San Doppleton". The stairs go up to the north and down to the south.
You are in the mayor's [office]. To the east is a [window] overlooking a second-[story] drop. There is a [glass box] mounted on the north [wall].
You are dangling over a three-[story] drop, desperately clutching the [window ledge] with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.
On this end of the [street], a [department] [store] called [Barkley's] sits to the south.
You are in the [clothing department] at Barkley's. There are many [racks of clothes] here. You may exit to the north. To the southwest lies the hardware [department], and southeast is the cosmetics [department].
The shelves are lined with [bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray], and other [cosmetic paraphernalia]. You can go northwest to the clothing [department], or west to the hardware [department].
The place is filled with debris from the riots. Lying on the ground you see a [rope] and a [hammer] which have been randomly flung off the shelves.
You are on the [roof] of the [government] [building]. You can go back down the stairs to the north. There is a [lightning rod] sticking up.
You're at your [workbench] in the [center] of your private [laboratory], a small [part] of the Wayne Research Lab in the town of Frobton. The [videophone] [screen] looms overhead, with its [alarm bell] ringing. [Tip] is here. A [microphone] is sitting on your [workbench]. The [alarm bell] continues to ring.
You're in the north [part] of your [lab]. A [Computestor] stands here to [help] test your inventions. [Tip] is [off] to the south.
You're in the east [part] of your [lab]. A [doorway] leads out past the [Electrical] [Panel] through a short corridor to the [office] of your [lab assistant], [Sharon Kemp]. A Microwave Security Scanner stands against the [wall]. An [intercom] sits on your [desk]. [Tip] is [off] to the west.
You're in a short [corridor], with your [lab] to the west, a storage closet to the south, and an [office] to the east. An [Electrical] [Panel] fills most of the north [wall].
You're in the [office] of your [lab assistant], Sharon Kemp. There is a [desk and chair] here, and a [door] leading out to the parking [lot]. To the west, a hallway leads back to your [lab].
Sharon is looking through the [file drawer]. There's a [file drawer] here. The [file drawer] is filled with a [lot] of business [papers].
You're in the south [part] of your [lab], next to [shelves] [full of chemical and electronic] [supplies]. A [door] leads south to the test [tank]. [Tip] is [off] to the north.
You're at a temporary [runway] or [gangplank] that leads from the walkway to the entry [hatch] of the SCIMITAR. The [hatch] is open.
You're at a [work counter], next to the [control] [gear] used to [operate] the test [tank]. The test [tank] (which is now empty of [sea] water) is located in a large [work room], just south of your private [laboratory], with concrete-block [walls] on three sides and a [high] metal [roof]. Most of its floor is dug out and lined with steel, to form the huge [tank] used for developing and testing [underwater] [gear] and the [pilot] models of your submarine craft. There's a walkway around the [tank] on three sides -- north, west and south. On the east side, a steel [gate] forms the [wall] of the [room]. Sitting on the [work counter] is: a catalyst capsule
You're in the pilot's [seat] of the SCIMITAR, its [operating] [control] [panel] before you. A wraparound [viewport], both fore and aft, provides a view ahead and astern. You can also observe your surroundings with [sonarscope] and a hydrophone listening device. There's a sonarphone for communication. You'll discover other features when you need them. [Tip] is sitting in the back [seat], reading a [magazine].
The [space] is dimly illuminated by small [work lights], but you can see [machinery] everywhere.
You're now in the [docking] [tank], at the foot of the [ramp].
You're now atop the north [wall] of the Aquadome's docking [tank]. This gives you a bird's-eye view of the whole Undersea Research Station of Inventions Unlimited.
You're at the foot of the [ladder]. Zoe Bly and the Aquadome [crew] are [still] here.
Commander Bly is here. The five Aquadome [crew] members are here.
You're in the very [center] of the Aquadome, where the Air [Supply System] rises like a tower, almost to the top of the dome itself. Commander Bly is [off] to the south. The five Aquadome [crew] members are [off] to the south.
From here, you can go east or south into the building. Commander Bly is [off] to the west. The five Aquadome [crew] members are [off] to the west.
The [room] is crowded with [supplies and equipment]. If you want to find something, you'll have to [search] for it.
The Aquadome [office] is small but tidy, with a single [door] leading out and a good view of the [ocean] through the [window]. Tip is playing with the station [monitor].
From here, you can go west or south into the [dorm]. [Mick Antrim] is [off] to the east. [Marv Siegel] is [off] to the east.
Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the [room] made [for] sleeping. There is a [high bed] here that is not your [bed] although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting [room] is south of here and the [room] with the [water] is to the west.
You are on a [path] through a blighted [forest]. The [trees] are sickly, and there is no undergrowth at all. One [tree] here looks climbable. The [path], which ends here, continues to the northeast.
This is your [chamber] in the [Hall] of the Guild of Enchanters, with a [doorway] to the west. A private [chamber] is a great privilege, especially for an Enchanter as young as yourself, but how many Enchanters can say they defeated the infamous Krill? Your [bed] occupies the far corner of the [room].
Tacked to the [doorframe] of your [room] is a [note], hurriedly scribbled on parchment.
The personal [chamber] of Belboz, who presides over the [Circle of Enchanters], is appointed with a beautiful woven [wall hanging], an exotic morgia [plant], and a wide darkwood [desk] crafted by the artisans of [Gurth]. The [hallway] lies to the east. Pacing back and forth on a [perch] in the corner is Belboz's prized pet [parrot], native to the [jungles of Miznia].
Rooms lie to the east and west from this north-south corridor. A large marble [archway] to the south leads into an open area.
Affixed to the southern [arch] is an ornate brass [receptacle], intended for use by messengers.
Among the provisions here is a small ochre-colored [vial], closed and [labelled] with tiny [lettering]. There is a [calendar] here (providing light). There is a depleted [matchbook] here.
Lying open on a [stand] in one corner is a heavy [volume], probably a [copy] of the [Encyclopedia] [Frobizzica]. The servants have been lax lately, for a [scroll] is lying among the dust in the corner.
At the far end of the cellar, draped in cobwebs, is a large [trunk]. At each corner of its [lid] is a [button]: a black [button] with a picture of a [star], a gray [button] depicting the [moon], a red [button] illustrated with a bloody [knife], and a purple [button] engraved with a royal [crown]. In the center of the [lid] is a white [button] picturing a [dove] in flight.
Among Helistar's possessions is a [scroll], new and shiny.
To the west, a [path] enters the blighted [woods], which stretch out of sight. A [signpost] stands beside another [path] leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the [signpost] is a slimy [hole] leading down.
You are in the center of a barren [field]. To the east is the [turret] of a ruined [castle], and from the northeast comes the sound of rushing water.
You are on a muddy [bank] of a fast-moving [river], full of sharp rocks and foaming [rapids], flowing to the southwest. The ground is soft and eroded, and continually threatens to dump you into the turbulent [waters]. A [field] lies to the southwest, and a trail leads southeast along the [bank].
You are on the [bed] of an evaporated [river]. [Fish] splash helplessly in tiny [puddles]. The [bed] leads northwest and southeast. A climb up the southwest [bank] is possible. To the northeast is a dark [cave], hollowed out by years of rushing [water].
Lying in the corner, in a [pile] of bat [guano], is a [scroll]. There is an amber [vial] here.
In the center of the [room] is a deep pit filled with countless bones, an indication of the brutality of dungeon life. There are exits south and southwest. High above you is a small opening in the [ceiling].
Sitting near one of the torture [devices] is an indigo [vial, labelled] in tiny [letters].
This is the dark and dank dungeon of the ruined castle. There's probably a torture [chamber] nearby. You can go east, northeast, or upward. A small opening leads down as [well].
You are at the northeastern rim of a gigantic crater, the result of some ancient explosion. A wide underground [highway], which ends at the crater's edge, leads northeast.
This is a featureless [tunnel], narrowing to the west. To the east is a deep [gorge], probably too wide to jump across.
Growing in the center of the [room] is a [tree], thick with foliage. As though to disprove the ancient adage, every [branch, bow, and twig] has a [zorkmid] [coin] growing on it.
A fat old gnome with a long white [beard] is sleeping soundly just outside the [toll booth]. His loud snores echo around the caverns.
The underground road ends here. A [hovel], carved into the rock, lies to the east. To the north, wide marble [stairs] lead upward.
Standing in the center of the [hall] is a life-sized [statue]. An [inscription] at the base is in a familiar language.
Through a breathtaking [archway] of glass to the east is an area glistening with reflected light. Another exit leads south.
You are inside a huge cubical [maze], shimmering with light from an unseen source above. It is impossible to tell if the [walls] and ceilings around you are glass surfaces or openings. Since you are standing on something, the floor must be solid, but it is virtually invisible and you feel as though you were walking on air.
Near the glass [arch] is a small rectangular brick [structure]. The center of the [structure] is a [hole] about a foot wide, leading down into darkness. There is a parchment [scroll] here.
You are amongst the [ruins] of an ancient castle. A winding [stairway] leads up to a crumbling turret, and a dark passage leads downward. A path heads through the rubble to the west.
You are at the entrance to Fort [Griffspotter], which lies to the east. A [trail] leads along the [river bank] to the northwest.
A tattered [flag], apparently that of ancient Quendor, still flies atop a mighty [flagpole] in the center of the field.
A magnificent cast-iron [cannon] stands atop the battlement. Its wide, shallow [barrel] points toward the [ocean], as though daring enemy ships to approach.
You have entered a shadowy [pit] full of nooks and crannies. From every direction you hear the hissing of vipers and the irregular clicking of giant [beetles]. Light spills down from above, and a small [crack] leads further downward into darkness.
This is a moist [room] whose [walls] are thick with [moss and lichens]. A small [hole] leads up and a rocky passage leads south.
This looks like the entrance to a run-down amusement [park], no longer gaudy with lights and glitter. A sign above the entrance proclaims "Welcome to [Bozbarland] - The Entertainment Capital of the Empire." The [park] lies to the west and a tunnel leads northeast.
You are at the eastern end of a long midway. The [park] entrance lies to the east, and rides lie to the north and south.
Entrances lead north, west and south, and the rest of the [midway] lies to the east.
A [hawker] stands within the [booth], studying you through half-closed eyes. "C'mon, pal!" cries the [hawker] from the game [booth]. "Try your luck!" He holds the [ball] out toward you.
You have entered a large [room] whose [walls] are covered with intricate [carvings]. The largest and most striking [carving], on the southern wall, is of a huge sleeping [dragon]! A winding tunnel leads north.
The [walls] and ceiling of this [room] are covered with soot and held up by timbers which don't look very sturdy.
This is obviously the heart of a large [coal] mine, illuminated by a [wall]-mounted [lamp]. The bottom of a metal [coal chute] is visible at the north end of the [room]. Another [chute] continues downward at the southern end. A large [coal bin] is overflowing, and the floor is completely covered with [lumps of coal]. A [passage] leads east, but a western [passage] is blocked by [rubble].
On the eastern wall is a heavy [door] with a [dial] set into it.
Another exit leads west, and a wall-mounted lamp provides illumination. The floor is deeply covered with [lumps of coal].
Lying in one corner is a [coil] of rope.
Lying near the mouth of one passage is a [wooden] [timber], probably left over from the construction of the mine.
You are at the western end of the [coal] mine. A metal [chute] leads downward.
There is a shimmering [scroll] here. Mounted securely to the wall is a kerosene [lamp], filling the [room] with a serene orange glow. A small [compartment] at its base is open.
This is a narrow beach between a small [cove] to the east and tall cliffs to the west. The [shore] curves to the southeast and northeast. A metal [chute] leads up into the cliff.
You are swimming on the surface of a calm [lagoon], whose [sandy] floor is visible below. A curved beach surrounds this [inlet] on its western side.
You are standing on the western [shore] of the mighty Flathead [Ocean]. According to legends you read at the University, the eastern [shore] of this [ocean] is a strange land of magical beings and priceless treasures. You could go north along the [shore]; the edge of a small [cove] lies to the southwest.
A mighty [river] spills into the [ocean] here. Looking up the [river] valley, you see a tall [waterfall]. Atop a cliff, high above you, is the [rampart] of a [fortress]. A cave entrance at the base of the cliff to the west is blocked by writhing green [vines].
A [pack of grues] fills the [room]! The [grues], contrary to all conventional wisdom, aren't bothered by your light in the least. They must be mutated [grues], no longer fearing light! They seem to be ignoring you, aside from a few suspicious gurgles in your direction.
This [cavern] is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with powerful-looking [machinery]. You recognize a [breeder] for producing millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other [devices] seem designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of [Enchanters] everywhere.
An acrid stench fills this small [room], which is obviously a control center for the evil experiments in the [cavern] outside. Hanging on the wall is a heavy [dagger], its [handle] encrusted with diamonds. [Belboz] is lying here, motionless but not asleep. He seems to be in some sort of trance.
You are in the Council [Chamber] of the ancient Guild Hall at Borphee. To the south is the entry of the Guild Hall. There is a meeting of the [Guildmasters] going on. You are standing among a group of about ten [sorcerers], each the master of an [Enchanters] Guild chapter somewhere in the land.
This is the entrance to the Guild Hall in Borphee. To the north is the Council [Chamber], and to the south is an [exit] leading outside. Little is left of the sumptuous buffet lunch. Only a [loaf of bread] and some smoked [fish] remains.
You can't see anything, what with the [smokey] orange [cloud] that blankets the square.
You are in midair. You are falling. You are very high above a trackless [wilderness] to the east of a range of jagged [mountains].
Fortunately a very large [bird] is carrying you, otherwise you would fall. You are above a trackless [wilderness] to the east of a range of jagged [mountains].
The [roc] perches on the side of the [nest], watching you intently. There is a stained [scroll] here.
This is a long hall built of crudely dressed [stone]. The [blocks] are as tall as you and the ceiling invisible in the gloom above. Dirt trickles from gaps in the walls and ceiling. The atmosphere is oppressive, and there is a dry, stale smell all around. The corridor extends north and south from here.
Here the main corridor opens into a vast underground space. Your light can barely illuminate a fraction of it. All around are cyclopean [blocks] of stone, crudely carved [statues, and constructs] of unimaginable purpose. Nearby the [portico] of a building has collapsed, and a [pillar] has smashed the pavement and exposed a small [channel] filled with swiftly rushing water. Water stains indicate that at one time the water flooded the entire area. Wedged against a [pillar], as though by rushing water, is a [zipper].
This is the upper end of a narrow, winding [path] up a sheer [cliff]. From here you can see that any further extension of the [path] was destroyed by a rock slide at some relatively recent time. There are many [rocks] precariously balanced above you. It looks like the slightest disturbance could bring them down on you. Frustratingly, you can see the remains of a small [building] just beyond the dangerous area, but there is no way to get there from here.
You are clinging to a [boulder] that is floating in midair. There are many other [boulders] around, also floating, and lots of dust and dirt, also not moving. One particularly large [boulder] with good handholds is above you. Below you is the cliff face.
A nice oblong [boulder] is above, and another large one is below you.
Below you is a long oblong [boulder]. Above you there are no more [boulders], but there is a continuation of the trail that you were on.
This is the top of the [mountain]. There is a crudely built [stone hut] nearby to the west. There is a gold [coin] here.
The [hut] is made of irregular [stones]. The walls are chinked with [moss, mud], small [stones], a featureless white [cube], and an occasional old [fur].
There is a pair of pruning [shears] here. There is a [weed plant] here. It's tall, with yellow blossoms dripping pollen.
A well-worn [trail] terminates here where a [cave] enters the [cliff]-side to the north. Outside the [cave] is a [litter of bones], old [hides and brush]. The smell that issues from the [cave] is mephitic. To the east is the bottom of a sheer [cliff].
This is a natural fissure in the rock which was enlarged with crude skill into a spacious and comfortable [room], at least if you're fond of [caves]. The floor is [dirt], hard packed in some parts, loose in others. A low passage leads down. A large [ogre] bars the passage.
There is a [dusty] [scroll] here. There is a gold [box] here.
This is a damp, [mossy] [room]. Its floor is [mud], and its walls and ceiling are [coral]. In the gaps in the [coral] you can see a shimmering [film] which you realize is actually the outer edge of a huge [bubble] of air enclosing you. On the north, east and south sides of the [room] are curtains of [bubbles].
This is an oubliette. Sheer walls rise for twenty feet above you and lean inward to a narrow [opening] covered with wooden planks. A small but fast-flowing [channel] of water runs along the bottom of the [chamber] between two [pipes].
You are inside a small ceramic [pipe] nearly filled with fast-flowing cold water. The walls of the [pipe] are slippery and overgrown with [mossy] [slime] wherever an irregularity shields the growth from the force of the water. Going east (against the current) would be nearly impossible. Going west is almost unavoidable.
On the north side of the [pipe] is such an irregularity: a large [chunk] has been knocked out of the [pipe], and the [slime and moss] grows abundantly. Inside, covered with [moss and slime], is something large, white, and apparently cubical.
The [pipe] here is smashed from the top where a huge pillar has toppled over onto it. Cyclopean ruins are all around you. The cracks and fissures in the [pipe] might make it possible to climb out here. The water is fast and loud around you.
Here a long north-south corridor meets an east-west cross corridor whose walls are polished to almost mirror smoothness. Just to your north is a huge scaly [mass] which fills the entire cross corridor. Its thickness is more than three times your height and its length is unguessable.
Just to your south is a large [snake] whose head pokes out of one side of the cross corridor and the tip of whose tail pokes out the other side. You can see that ahead is more of the crudely built main hall, and beyond that is a dark area.
This is a [ruined] temple to a forgotten [god]. Black basalt [pillars] reach to the ceiling, but some are broken and lie in huge [fragments] on the ground. The air is stale and filled with the odor of decay. [Bats] roost in the [rafters], the only remaining worshippers. Before the temple stands a tall basalt [idol] in the form of a huge rodent. Its [fang]-bedecked [mouth] is open slightly, exposing [teeth] and tongue.
Its [fang]-bedecked [mouth] is open in an embarrassing yawn.
You are on a large fluffy white cloud. In fact, you are surrounded by [clouds]. They blow past, wind seeming to boil them around you from all sides. There is a bit of clear air to the north, momentary gaps in the [clouds] to the south and west, and an alarming one below you.
Directly in front of you to the east is a shop. Above its [door] is a [sign] in an unknown tongue. You can't read it, but it is illustrated with a picture of a very ornate rug. The [door] beckons invitingly.
A young and earnest-looking [merchant] stands near a [pile] of carpets. He is carrying in his arms a beautiful blue carpet with a design of cubes on it and a scruffy red carpet that's shabby and badly made.
It is completely full of icy water. Sheer walls enclose it on all sides. In the ceiling is a narrow [opening].
The hall ends at a blank wall, but a [cell] lies to the north. There is no door on the [cell].
This was once a very luxurious [cell], obviously for the imprisonment of a highborn or powerful person. Its rich [hangings] are now rotten [rags]; its furniture is smashed to kindling, except for one massive oak [cabinet]. The [cell] door has been blown away by an explosion, or perhaps a "rezrov" [spell].
This is the guard [tower] of a crumbling castle. It overlooks a [mountainous] landscape of [tarns], tumbled [rock], and twisted low [trees]. The vegetation is in browns, blacks, and ochres. The only real color is provided by a distant [volcano] which [lights] the lowering clouds with bright red and yellow coruscations. The only [exit] is down.
You are partway up the base of an active [volcano]. All around you is a stream of glowing, molten [lava], bubbling and spitting. Clumps of red-hot [lava] fly through the [air], narrowly missing you. Your vantage point is a small point of [rock] that hasn't been remelted by the flow.
This is a [room] of smooth bare [marble]. It has no exits. A compass [rose] lies discarded in a corner.
This [room] is a perfectly carved, smoothed and shaped cube of black [marble]. There are no exits, but [inset] in the north wall is a [carving] of a compass [rose].
This [room] is in the shape of an octagonal solid carved from [marble]. The floor and ceiling are the octagons and each wall is a rectangle. On each wall is inlaid a rune indicating a direction: the north wall has "north" carved on it, and so on. The east, northeast, southeast and southwest [runes] are lead, the rest are of silver.
The northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest [runes] are lead, the rest are of silver.
The west, northwest and southwest [runes] are lead, the rest are of silver.
The west rune is gold, the north, northeast and northwest [runes] are lead, the rest are of silver. On the west wall just under the rune is an octagonal [hole plugged] with a perfectly fitting piece of alabaster.
The [runes] are all of lead. A white [cube] is here.
This is a flat plain punctuated by [boulders]. The [boulders] are all identical and slide to and fro on the eerie surface, propelled by an unknown mechanism. The ground is [scratched] by many intersecting [lines] which seem to have a regular pattern. From where you are standing you can see [lines] radiating north, east, west and south. There is a large green eyed [rock] here. Also, there is a large brown eyed [rock] with a featureless white [cube] on its back some distance to the east. Far in the distance are [mountains] which quiver itchily as they belch forth purple fire.
You are on a large, green eyed [rock]. From where you are perched you can see [lines] radiating north, east, west and south.
From where you are perched you can see [lines] radiating north, west and south.
Sitting on the brown eyed [rock] you see: a [cube]
This [room] is totally black, so black that you see nothing when you look around it. All light is absorbed by the substance of the place. You can tell it is physical, because you can feel your feet touching the floor, but your eyes tell you nothing.
This is a large [cave] with a rough floor. You can tell little about the surroundings, because your frotz [spell] doesn't seem to be working normally here and produces only a wan and sickly glow. The [light] coming from the magic [burin] has been reduced to a thin, barely glowing stream of tiny blobs that drips, spurts and sputters uselessly to the ground. There it collects into a small [pile] which is slowly disappearing, perhaps by evaporation.
This is a large underground [chamber] filled with nightmarish, barely visible [shapes]. There is very dim [light] issuing from somewhere near the center of the [room].
The burning sensation gets worse and worse. You struggle against it, but the [light] is just too much. You lose consciousness, sink to the bottom of the [pool], and expire.
In this [room], the walls are brick and glow a deep red. The floor itself radiates heat, and in fact the entire [room] is hot, oppressive and smokey. Searing heat radiates from openings in the north, east and south walls.
You are at the edge of a [lava] vent in an active [volcano]. The [lava] glows red and yellow, and there is a stench of sulphur in the air. A lake of [lava] bubbles and steams before you, molten [rock] roiling from unseen disturbances. To the west, in the middle of the tumult, is a small [outcropping] of something with a higher melting point than [rock]. It is undisturbed by the heat.
This is the nexus of a web of multicolored strings and threads of light. They come in from the far distance in graceful curves or tangled, jagged paths. In the center of the [room] they tie together into a ball that looks like gossamer yarn or glowing cotton candy. One bright set of threads points south to a gap in the weave and another points east to a similar gap.
This is a bare concrete [chamber] that looks like the inside of a vault. The [room] is filled with unimaginable [treasure]. [Gold and jewels] are strewn everywhere. Coffers burst with [coins], and stacks of rare [paintings] lean against the walls. Beautifully ornamented [vases and glassware] are carelessly stacked in corners. There is a [door] on the north side of the [room] whose lock [mechanism] is visible. The [door] is closed and locked.
You are in a large, bare concrete [room]. There are two piles on the floor. The first contains the "x1" cube, the "x2" cube, the "x3" cube, the "x4" cube, the "x5" cube and the "x6" cube. The second contains the "x7" cube, the "x8" cube, the "x9" cube, the "x10" cube, the "x11" cube and the "x12" cube. An exit is to the north. It is a closed iron [door]. To the south is the inner vault. Its steel [door] is closed.
A thin trickle of sand flows down from an exit in the ceiling of this circular [room] to a pile of sand on the floor. The walls of the [room] are glass, but you can see nothing through them. In the sand is a hole through which, oddly enough, no sand is pouring out.
This is a luxurious [cell], obviously for the imprisonment of a highborn or powerful person. Its rich [hangings] and heavily ornamented [furniture] speak of a prisoner whose comfort is important even during imprisonment. A massive oak [cabinet] dominates one wall. The massive [cabinet] is closed. The [cell door] is closed.
This is the south end of a vast [chamber] filled with partially [ruined] structures. Here the [portico] of a building is collapsing. The [pillars] holding it up are starting to crumble. One has recently fallen and smashed the pavement. The fall exposed and the rubble blocked a small [channel] filled with swiftly rushing water which is rapidly inundating the area. You are in a small area not yet flooded. There is a [sack] here.
This place is odd indeed. Nothing that you look at is what it seems. If you look at something carefully enough it turns out to be something entirely different. The [room] is cluttered with objects and obviously hasn't been cleaned in a long time. The floor is overgrown with [grass and weeds], and rabbits have chewed them. There are bird [nests] around the ceiling and [droppings] here and there. A very untidy and unsettling place. Much of the walls, ceiling and floor is covered in mirrors. There are empty, mirrorless square areas at north and south and a round black emptiness to the east.
This is the audience [chamber]. It is high and spacious, and every proportion and decoration is intended to highlight the [throne] that looms before you. The [throne] itself is bathed in [light], but only featureless gray may be seen through the [windows and skylights].
You are standing in a monastery chapel. [All] around you, fellow [Brothers] of the Order are standing, [chanting]. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother [Joseph] stands in deep concentration, holding the [Rod] of the Ancients.
You are in the Monastery gardens, where various shrubs and conifers are covered in a light blanket of [snow]. An open cloister lies to the west, while a doorway heads east.
This is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A [brazier] sits in the center of the room.
Brother [Joseph] is here, standing by the [altar].
You are in Brother [Toolbox's] quarters, vacant ever since he left the order due to differences many years ago.
A large [rose]-colored [window] lets some light in.
You are in the Monastery library, a cozy, almost cramped room with [shelves] of various [books].
You are in Brother Pufpistery's domain -- the dreaded acolyte kitchen. A huge soup [cauldron] sits unused nearby. The refectory is south.
You are in a small cramped storeroom, stocked with various crates and [barrels] of foodstuffs. The refectory is west.
You are standing near the top of a [snowy] mountain peak. The wind is quite cold and is making your teeth chatter. The general vicinity is mostly [snow] and rock; however, the entrance into the Monastery is to the north, all but hidden from view by the enormous slabs of [snow]-covered rock that make up the cliff face. There is a rough but obvious trail leading down the mountain to the south. There is also another trail that winds even further up the mountain peak almost hidden in the [snow] to the east.
You are climbing up a small trail that gets periodically lost in great bluffs of [snow]. The swirling [snow] makes seeing an unusual effort. The trail leads downwards to a cliff face to the west, and rises towards the mountain top to the north.
You are standing on the top of a peak of the Gray Mountains. A cold wind blows [snow] everywhere, obscuring what would otherwise surely be a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside. You can just make out some buildings to the far south in Frostham. A [snowy] bluff marks the way back down, or to the west, there appears to be a [snowy] outcropping. It seems to hang precariously over the edge of the mountain, however.
You are standing on a [snow]-covered outcropping. You are almost waist-deep in [snow], and the blisteringly cold winds aren't helping. The outcropping juts out alarmingly over the western edge of the mountain. In fact, you can see the Monastery steeple below this ledge. The main portion of the mountain peak lies to the east.
You are on a rocky mountain trail that winds up and down a mountain. Patches of [snow] can be found here and there. The trail continues down the mountain to the south, or up to the north.
You are at a [snow]-filled crossroads in a mountain trail. Paths lead north towards the top of the mountain, east, west, and south towards the base of the mountain.
You're at the top of a short downwards slope into a [snowy] area below. A path leads east. You could also slide down the slope. A lone [tree] stands here, overlooking the slope.
You've made your way down to a small [snow]-covered clearing, ringed by pine trees. The only exit is back up the slope.
You're on top of the [tree], on some lower [branches] that seem pretty stable.
You are standing on a wide smooth [river of ice]. The [river] 'runs' east to west, and there are banks to the north and south.
This is an exceptionally cramped attic, obviously unused for some time. The [floorboards] are starting to crack. An exit heads south.
You are in a [waiting room] in the house of the Frostham Governor. The carpet is surprisingly plush. The walls have been painted a rather bland [peach]-like color. The furnishings are also colored [peach], which complements the walls without being too nouveau. The way out is to the northeast.
You are in a rather spacious [office]. The carpeting is quite plush, and [all] the furnishings seem excessively lavish.
You are standing at the entrance to the Frostham Great Underground Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the [gate] to the southeast, or stairs lead up into the city.
You are standing in a long underground chamber. The east side of the room contains a lowered set of what appear to be [train tracks]. The [tracks] run south into a dark tunnel. Along one wall painted lettering reads "FROSTHAM STATION". A short walkway leads northwest, to a [metal fence].
There is a large [train car] sitting on the [tracks] to the east.
You are in an underground train car. Various people fill the train, some in uncomfortable-looking [seats].
The [tracks] run north and south into dark tunnels. Along one wall painted lettering reads "ARAGAIN STATION".
The south side of the room contains a lowered set of what appear to be [train tracks]. The [tracks] run west into a dark tunnel.
The tracks run east and west into dark tunnels. Along one wall painted lettering reads "ANTHAR STATION". A short walkway leads north, to a [metal fence].
You are standing at the entrance to the Greater Anthar Great Underground Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the [gate] to the south, or stairs lead up into the city.
A rather lovely flower [garden] lies before you. The multi-colored [flowers] are turning the air into perfume. The conservatory entrance is northwest, or more greenhouse [gardens] lie to the north and east. A tiny trail leads south past the flower beds.
A garden path winds through this long greenhouse, which is filled with [plants] native to [jungle] settings. The environment is somewhat humid. The path heads west and north from here.
This [small] back room is apparently the conservatory nursery. Bits of soil and plant debris are everywhere, along with immature seedling plants. A exit lies west, partially covered by some cloth.
A tasteful [fountain] intercepts a north-south garden trail here.
You are standing in a small well-kept garden. The plots surrounding the paths are filled with a variety of general ground-cover plants, [all] appropriate for most discerning homeowners. Exits lie north and south.
Delbin's Pub has been a popular food and drink spot in South Anthar for quite a while. Usually, you need to fight off [barbarians] to find a place to sit. At the moment, however, the place is unusually quiet. A [group of barbarians] seem paralyzed with fear near the back wall, glancing nervously at the front of the [bar].
A [group of barbarians] are making a lot of noise nearby.
The west side of the room contains a lowered set of what appear to be [train] tracks.
A short walkway leads northeast, to a [metal fence].
There is a large [train car] sitting on the tracks to the west.
You are standing at the entrance to the New Borphee Great Underground Subway (GUS) station. The train platform lies past the [gate] to the southwest, or stairs lead up into the city.
You're on some busy side street in New Borphee. There's a crowded walk back east. To the north is the entrance to some sort of [open] area, with a large [open arch].
You're standing under an open [archway] that has the letters "GUE TECH" prominently displayed in twisted brass and copper. A busy street lies to the south, and the campus quad opens up to the north.
There's a large field house here, filled with gym [equipment] and helpful rubber [mats].
The center of the campus is a nicely tended green lawn with a [bronze statue] in the center. Paths lead north and south across grassy fields. To the west is a small brick building. To the east is a large stone building with a lintel roof and the words "WOOMAX LIBRARY" enscribed across the entrance.
You're in a short hallway inside some student [dormitories].
A [student] library is here, filled with various texts.
You're in very deep jungle, just on the verge of getting lost. Your surroundings are green and untamed. A path leads northeast, while a [muddy] path heads south.
You're knee-deep in a murky swamp. Huge swamp [grasses] wall you in. Drier land is north or south.
The Jungle clears out a bit here, so you can actually see patches of sky and walk [ten] paces without running into a tree. There's a path into the jungle undergrowth to the north. You notice a [group] of jungle [natives] gathered here.
Huge swamp [grasses] wall you in, except for a section to the west.
You're standing in front of a small [farmhouse]. A trail leads northeast, a sand bar lies to the southwest, and another trail heads east.
A coastline sand bar curves west a short distance here, ending in a shoal of large rocks. Nearby, someone has dug some shallow [holes] in the sand, probably farming for live Rotund Oysters, a popular Eastland delicacy.Unfortunately, the oyster [beds] are too far inland, and they appear to be empty. A bit to the west you can see a small shoreline cave in the rocks.
[Dark] forest meets [dark] city outskirts here. The only exit is along an old path to the southwest -- the forest is too thick for travel otherwise. Rain falls periodically from a [dark stormy] [sky].
This was once probably a [pantry] of some sort. It's now a bare closet-sized room.
Before you is a truly astounding sight. A huge metal [gate] to the south blocks the [entrance] into the newly built Aragain Royal Grounds. Worse yet, a seemingly endless [line of people] stands before the [gate]. They look like [dignitaries], [diplomats], or just plain [politicians]. A walkway heads north.
You're standing in a lovely courtyard with magnificent [topiary] designs and real marble walkways. A large [gate] stands to the north. To the east is a red stone building with spires and columns. To the west is a large flat stone building. To the south is a huge [entranceway] into what must be the new Royal Palace, which appears to be carved out of the face of a massive mountain.
You're walking along a very narrow [wood beam] that runs east to west into darkness. Below, you can see the dark silhouette of a network of [beams] and floating cubes. Much farther below you can see a dull red glow.
Both above and below, you can see the dark silhouette of a network of [beams] and floating cubes. Farther below you can see a dull red glow.
This is a giant audience hall, equivalent to a large auditorium with a throne on the stage. The hall is filled with luxurious decorations -- red carpeting, expensive chandeliers, sweeping gold-edged drapery. The hall is also currently filled with a large number of [dignitaries] and important-looking [people] taking up [all] the seats. Open brass doors lie to the north.
You're in the entrance to a museum. The lighting is rather dim, throwing light shadows [all] over the walls. There are exhibit rooms to the north and south, or an exit west.
You are in a square exhibit room with wood flooring and plain plaster walls. In the center of the room is an exhibit [platform] made from a large [slab of marble]. The room is lit brightly by hidden torches.
You are in a small exhibit room designed with dark wood floors and plaster-on-stucco [walls]. The room is dimly lit by hidden lamps or torches behind recessed [wall] niches.
A tastefully overdone lounge with tapestries and gold enamel finished walls. The room is dimly [lit], although you see no windows or other sources of light. Open hallways lead east and west.
A sight to inspire even the most avaricious, this storeroom is filled with [all] sorts of rare and precious [treasures]. A hallway leads east. You notice that the west wall appears to be made of solid granite.
You're on a nice new bridge crossing some large [river] below. Trails lead north and south into woods.
You are in a large man-made underground chamber, with a perfectly domed high ceiling. Smooth stone archways lead to rooms to the north, south, east and west. Stone cut steps lead down. In the very center of the ceiling you notice a strange circular [depression] in the stone.
This is a bare cubical stone chamber. Some worn [black lettering] on the wall reads: "THE NORTH CHAMBER HAS SILVER [LETTERING]". An archway exits west.
Some worn [black lettering] on the wall reads: "EITHER I AM THE SECOND TROPHY ROOM AND THE NORTH CHAMBER IS THE LAST TROPHY ROOM, OR I HAVE GOLD [LETTERING]". An archway exits east.
Some worn [black lettering] on the wall reads: "THE EAST CHAMBER HAS SILVER [LETTERING] AND I HAVE GOLD [LETTERING]". An archway exits north.
Some worn [black lettering] on the wall reads: "THE EAST CHAMBER IS NOT THE FIRST TROPHY ROOM". An archway exits south.
In the very center of the ceiling you notice a circular [hole].
This is an odd room, cramped even by [lab] standards. The place seems to have been cleared out recently.
Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Stranger still is the upright rectangular [hole] in the fabric of space that stands in the center of this area. Otherwise, you could wander this gray dimension in any direction, it seems.
You're in a large dark tunnel that seems to run north and south. To the south you see light. There seem to be [two metal tracks] running along the ground.
This is an odd long hallway running north and south. The [stone] floor is noticeably concave, sloping upwards to the east and west. It's like being in a long [stone] channel.
You're in a small stone chamber. In the center of the floor is a strange [funnel]-like [depression], which starts as a large circular [opening], and narrows into a very small [tunnel] below, probably no wider than your hand. You also see a small round [hole] in the ceiling above. An exit heads west.
You're in a bare stone chamber which is partially filled with a sunken [pool] of dirty blackish [water]. Near the south wall is a [depression] in the floor that was probably a [drain] for the [pool], given the apparent [water] stains; however the level of the [pool] is below the point where it would overflow into the [drain]. Near the center of the ceiling is a small round [hole], right above the [pool]. An exit lies west.
You are in a stone chamber that has broken and eroded walls in several places. Broken stones and dirt are [everywhere]. It appears there was once an open archway east, however the heavy stones that framed it have collapsed. A tiny hole remains, but it would be an exceptionally tight squeeze. A stone ladder leads downwards into a dark hole.
You're in a [tiny] low room, dimly lit by strange glowing lichens and mosses. A [tiny] exit lies west between some collapsed rock -- it looks like a very tight squeeze. The room is otherwise filled with broken rock and the like. A [tiny round hole] is in the very center of the floor.
You feel a great sense of dread! Surely, given the way you got here, this must be the domicile of a dreaded Implementor! The entire place feels strange and alien and, well, "modern". There's some sort of kitchen to the east. Long [curtains] cover what must be a window to the south.
A room that could be a kitchen, if it didn't seem completely strange. Harsh bright lights seem to be coming from some unknown source. Strange-looking [white] countertops and cabinets fill the area, along with a [curious white] closet-like object. A room lies to the west.
A very curious small bedroom. A [white desk] sits here amongst other odd furnishings.
The [river] 'runs' east to west. To the north and south are huge snow bluffs that obscure most of the surrounding countryside.
Light gleams in from an open [trapdoor] above.
You've entered a wondrous natural cave, lit [everywhere] by reflected light from some sort of [purple] crystalline substance in the walls. A tunnel exits to the northwest.
You find yourself in a huge cavern. To the west is a large exit that looks out into a void of snow-covered mountains. There is a gigantic [white dragon] here!
You are on a long open boat, riding the waves of some great sea. The boat seems to be filled with [sailors] from some [militia].
You appear to be in front of Flathead Stadium once again, however something seems different. Even the stadium itself seems dissimilar, newer. Walkways lie southeast and southwest from here, or you can enter the stadium to the north. In front of the stadium is a [square hole].
This is a long square ditch that is likely to be the starting point for some building. It is framed by wood slats and short [brick walls]. The only way out is to the west.
Nothingness surrounds you. Yet, you feel like your conscious being extends into worlds and dimensions never imagined. You float in a [void] of total being.
You plunge through limitless [abysses] of inexplicably [coloured twilight] and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The [abysses] are by no means vacant, being crowded with [hazy objects], much like [shadows], that are moving around in a haphazard manner.
The [city] below you is [ancient]. [Dark domes] and steep [roofs] form a silent [silhouette] against the clear [star-filled] [sky]. You are standing on the [roof] of a [tower], built of crumbling [masonry], which seems to be centuries old. An [iron railing] of strange design circles the perimeter of the [roof] and a winding [staircase] leads down.
Dust and [spider webs] cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The [walls] are lined with [bookshelves] and a lone [desk] lies at one corner. Close to a [staircase], which leads further up and down the [tower], is a massive [table] made of [black stone]. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.
This damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the [tower]. A [staircase] provides access to the [higher] levels, while a [massive oak door], set in the southern [wall], leads out.
This is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern [wall]. There are some [shelves], mostly vacant, here.
This area in front of an old [tower] offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of [dark] stone [buildings]. Most [buildings] are [elliptical], built of irregular-sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any [doors] or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the [tower] is through the [door] to the north.
There is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange [elliptical] [buildings] on all sides except to the east, where a [high wall] built of massive [sandstone] blocks stands. There is a [road] to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the [sky] you see a [high tower] to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a [road] leads to what appears to be a [temple].
Wandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large [crack] yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous [elliptical] [buildings] to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The [road] extends to the east and west.
The building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The [walls] are covered with [mural carvings], whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone [walls] is interrupted by a [crack] that gapes into the southern [wall]. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.
A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. [Charles] is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.
The [road] to the public square, way back east, forks into a north-south [road] here. To the west looms yet another of the stone [buildings].
The ceaseless blandness of the surrounding architecture has a dimly sinister suggestiveness and you can't but help but wonder who the primal entities which rear, or reared, here are. The [road] leads north, deeper into the city.
This part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The [roads] are narrower and the [paving] is irregular, sometimes [stone slabs] and sometimes [cobblestones]. The [buildings] are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few [overhead bridges] from house to house. The [road] ends here and the only way out is to the north.
You are the top of an staircase, leading down into [darkness]. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.
The staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive [walls] rise, culminating in massive [vaults], on which [carvings] are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen [blocks, sand, and detritus] of every kind.
This is a Cyclopean north-south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A [side passage] once led west, but it has collapsed.
You are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the [mysterious] buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a [square opening] in the [ceiling].
This is a badly [heaped] east-west [corridor]. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north [wall] is the [entrance] to a [caved-in corridor].
This is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the [walls] reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique [gas stove] mounted in one of the [walls], and a [rack] just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.
An endless array of indistinguishably drab stone [buildings] lies at [either] side of the [road]. Though humbled by the sheer magnitude of the other [buildings], a distinctive [temple-like] [structure] catches your eye at the south end of the [road]. Flickering light emanates from its high and narrow [windows], casting uncertain shadows on the [murals] that adorn its wide [doorway].
The temple is an immense building, whose vaulted [ceiling] towers high above. It is scantily lit, but a [stage] is set in its southern part. On the [stage] there is a [huge statue], whose appearance is frightening even from this distance. In front of the [statue] is a [roughly] cube-shaped [black stone table]. There are lots of [people] in front of the [stage], and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer. The main exit is to the north.
The round chamber is badly damaged, and the south [wall] has partly collapsed, spreading [debris] over the floor. The [metal seals] have been forcibly thrown open and the [trapdoor] yawns open. A strong stench emerges from within the dark [opening].
You find yourself in a immense hall, faintly illuminated by [rays of light] falling from an [opening] in the distant [ceiling]. The far corners are all [shadows], and the purpose of the hall is hard to guess. A [strange device] is standing in the middle of the room.
From the [stage] you can see the northern part of the temple and the [many] [spectators] who observe all that takes place here. Dominating the [stage] is a [huge statue], made of [black stone]. In front of the [statue] is a [table]. There is a smell of death in the air and the [table], the [statue], and the floor are covered in fresh [blood].
This room is a tribute to the now-[faded] glory of the [theatre]. The still-[smiling faces] of forgotten productions stare out from [faded posters] at you. An old [grand staircase] leads up, while the exit lies to the south. [Small private doors] lead northeast and northwest.
Judging from the [desk] and lots of [papers] everywhere, this must have been the [manager's] [office]. [Doors] lead to the southeast and to the north.
You can barely make [anything] out in here. The only source of illumination is the light seeping in from the street-[level windows]. Not that it really matters because all this room seems to contain is [boxes] and a couple of [barrels].
The neighbourhood outside the theatre has deteriorated steadily over the last three decades, to the state of a slum (not that you would ever use that word, of course). Now a slight [mist] covers the litter-strewn [streets]. The street heads east and west into the murky twilight.
Boxes of [junk] line the walls, making the narrow hallway even more difficult to navigate through. Doors lead south and west, while the hallway continues north.
This [narrow] little [stairway] winds its way up to the west and down to the east.
This is a long wood-[panelled] corridor that goes north and south. A [narrow] little [staircase] leads down to the east from here, while a door goes west.
This is a long wood-[panelled] corridor that goes north from here.
This room seems to have contained [music] equipment. Battered [violin cases and coils] of various types of [strings] litter the floor. For the less [musically] inclined a door leads east.
In here were stored many of the smaller props once used in the theatre's production. Shelves full of [junk] line the walls. A [door] leads out to the north.
You have made your way up into the attic of the theatre. Wooden [studs and crossbeams] make progress through the room difficult but not impossible. [Cobwebs] and thick [dust] line the area. The attic continues further to the north.
Dust coats the [crossbeams], and covers the thinly [plastered] floor here. Looking through the [cracks] in some of the plaster, you can see that you are high above the theatre auditorium itself. The attic continues south from here, while to the north you notice a curious construction.
You conclude that this must be some kind of observatory, after all, what else could it be? However, why is it that instead of the usual dome, the [roof] just has a [strangely patterned window]? Also, instead of the normal studs and crossbeams, the [exposed wooden beams] of the [walls] are set at bizarre angles. It gives you the impression that you are inside a large multi-sided mathematical shape. An opening leads south.
Here, the [boxes] have recently collapsed, creating a [large pile of junk]. The air is very musty here. A [large pile of carpet rolls] have fallen over, effectively blocking the way north, but you can go back to the south.
The narrow hallway and its rows of [boxes] come to an end here. To the north is the back exit of the theatre while the hallway continues south, and an [office door] leads west.
You are behind the old theatre building in a small courtyard in the centre of the city block. On all sides tall buildings block you in. Once an alleyway allowed passage to the streets, but that alleyway was built over a couple of decades ago, so now the [large stage doors] to the south are quite useless. A small back entrance, however, lies to the southwest.
Here the [grand staircase] splits to the east and the west. You can also go back down to the south.
This landing circles around the upper level of the [lobby] allowing you to see down into it. The landing continues south and west, where it goes down the [lobby stairs]. A set of double doors lead north to the theatre auditorium itself, while a single finely carved wooden door leads east.
The landing sweeps around the theatre's entrance hall. Here, at the southern end, you are above the main doors, and you can look down to the [lobby] below. The landing continues to the northeast and northwest.
This aisle runs north and south through the [large theatre] auditorium, where you are surrounded by a sea of [seats]. Another aisle is to the west while the stage is to the north. [Double doors] lead south.
This is a [finely carpeted stairway] that leads down to a wooden door, and up to the north.
You are in the eastern [balcony] overlooking the [theatre] auditorium, where once the elite would have been seated enjoying the shows on the stage below. Far across from you to the west you can see the other [balcony seats]. The only exit for those who cannot fly is down to the south.
A thick [layer of dust] everywhere shows that no one has been here for quite a while, which is not surprising since there seems to be no way out of here. A [bricked-up] [doorway] once led west from here.
You seem to be crawling along inside a hollow in the wall separating the theatre from the building next to it. It is very dirty in here, and the lack of light makes it difficult to see [anything] clearly. The hollow continues south from here, while a hole lies to the southeast.
You have returned to the secret [library]. The room is filled with rows and rows of [bookcases], each containing [hundreds of old books]. The air is filled with the smell of musty paper. Aisles lead south, while a small recess lies to the north. To the east, a bookcase has collapsed leaving a [hole] in the wall.
This little recess appears to have been once a [reading] area. A [small reading table and chair] are still here. The library continues to the south.
You are at the southern end of the [library], surrounded by rows and rows of [old bookcases], all covered with strange [glistening] [ropes]. A cold and damp breeze blows in from a broken French window to the west, while a [library] aisle leads north.
The room is filled with a collapsed heap of [bookcase], each spilling its contents onto the floor.
You are at the southern end of the [library], amongst a [heap] of collapsed [bookcases].
You are high above a side [street] on an old stone balcony. Once, long ago when this part of the [city] wasn't abandoned, the view from here would have been incredible. Now, instead of glittering [lights] and flashing [signs], the view is of old boarded-up [shop fronts] and ruined [buildings].
You are high on the [roof] of the [theatre], near a [large chimney]. All around you, the [city] is starting to light up for the oncoming sunset. The [roof] slopes off dangerously in all directions but you know that you can safely go west to the balcony. Also a [chimney] leads down.
This is a rather posh little suite, probably used by the theatre's owner or perhaps by an occasional guest star actor. The room's [furniture] is of noticeably [superior quality] to the rest of the theatre, with a fine [four-poster] [bed]. A [fireplace] is in the western wall. A door leads back to the east.
This room was once an office but all of the furniture has been removed, leaving only a [small fireplace] in the west wall. A [door] once led east from here but you can see that it has been completely boarded up.
A [huge boiler] dominates this room. Its pipes extend through the walls, ensnaring them. A [shaft] from the [boiler] leads up, but, strangely, there seems to be no other exit out.
This is a long wood-[panelled] corridor that goes south from here.
Stepping into this room is like journeying back in time to another era. This room is filled with [racks and racks of old costumes]. The [costumes] range from Imperial Rome to World War I uniforms. An exit leads east.
This [small] room seems to be reserved for [medical] emergencies. The walls are covered with old [medical posters] giving cheerful descriptions on how to heal cuts, tend to burns, and deliver babies?! Healthy people can leave to the south.
This is a small room that has been sealed up. The [windows] have been boarded over, but faint light enters through cracks. The booth smells very bad, like [old] rotten meat.
This is a cramped dimly-lit room, empty but for the rows of [pictures] that are on the walls. A small door leads south.
Here you stand upon a stage that once would have been graced by the finest thespians in the country. However, now the only players upon this stage are the [spiders] who spin the [cobwebs], and who act out that never-ending saga of life, death, and life [again].
A jumble of [supports, ropes, and curtains] divide the back [stage] in to a maze of compartments. The general clutter isn't helped by the [rolls and rolls of canvas scenery] backdrops. The [stage doors], leading north, have been boarded over, and you can see that the [remains of stairs] leading up have been [pulled] down, so only the exit seems to be back south to the [stage].
You are suspended about five metres above the stage, clinging on to one of the many ropes. Across a narrow space you can see some [doors] set in the west wall that would have once lead onto a landing (which is long since gone). One of the [doors] is very close by.
This room was probably once an [old] dressing room, but it is hard to tell as [scuff marks] on the floor are the only traces of the room's original furniture left. A door leads east, back to the rope.
This depression would have been too small for [anything] but the most basic of orchestras. Looking about you can see why this is called a pit. You can go back up to the stage, or east to some [walk-in storage cupboards].
Once, people would have hung up their coats and hats here, but now the [hooks] lining the walls are home only for [cobwebs]. The lobby lies to the southwest.
This is an [old secret stairway] that leads up and down. The area is feebly lit by electrical [lights] set in the roof.
This is a miserably dank underground passage lined by [old brick [walls]]. The passage heads up to the west and continues to the east to a [locked] [iron door].
In the centre of this huge cavern-like room is a [large pit], somewhat reminding you of an empty indoor swimming [pool]. A passage heads off to the west to an open [iron door], while inside the [pit] you can see a passage leading down to the east.
The [rough walls] of the [pit] make an easy climb up and out of here. A gloomy tunnel heads east.
You have reached the western end of a [large sewage drainage] [trench] that continues east quite some smelly distance. A passageway leads northwest, back under the theatre.
You appear to be in the centre of the [drainage trench], which leads east and west from here. Above you, to the north, is a [strange] metal platform.
Here the [drainage trench] ends at a junction of [small pipes], each impassable. The [trench] leads west, while a tunnel leads southeast.
This [small] northwest-southeast tunnel is covered in [rotting sewage] and animal [droppings]. The tunnel ends at a [unusual archway] to the south-east.
You are on a metal platform, which grants a clear view of the entire [sewer] (for what it is worth) that lies down to the south.
Beyond the [archway] lies a [small] circular room of red [brick], shaped, oddly enough, like an Eskimo's igloo. Dominating the centre of the room is an [old iron cauldron], filled with an unknown [bubbling liquid]. All around the walls are [shelves] filled with [curious little vials] and other [knick-knacks] that seem to give you the impression of a [witch's] secret laboratory or the like. The only exit appears to be back to the northwest through the [archway].
You are standing on what seems to be someone's front [lawn]. A [gravel driveway] winds its way south while [hedges] block all other directions. To the north you can see a [large mansion]. The upper stories are ablaze.
Smoke circles around in the air making it difficult to breathe, but that is the only visible trace of the fire here in the long hallway. Doors and [stairs] lead off in all directions, but the safest one is to the south which leads outside. You notice that a [trail of blood] goes down some [stairs].
This was a [large] wine cellar that has been cleared out and put to a more sinister use. [Large tables filled with strange paraphernalia] are dotted about the room.
Judging from the [desk] and lots of [papers] everywhere you assume this must have been once the [manager's] [office].
While considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a [little] bit on the messy side. There is a king-size [bed] here with mountains of assorted [pillows]. A masterfully finished [dresser] graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.
Beautiful plants hang down from the ceiling and ceramic cherubims watch your every move in this small area off of the master bedroom to the east. To the south is a spacious walk-in [closet] with [mirrored] [doors].
No surprises here. [Towels] everywhere, [water] on the floor, even a couple of [toys] to boot. The hallway is just a couple of steps to the west.
Although you just finished cleaning this room an hour ago, it now looks like it hasn't been cleaned in about three weeks. The [bed] looks like it has been jumped on by an entire preschool. [Dirty clothes] are thoughtfully sprinkled across the floor, interspersed with assorted [toys and food items]. You can exit this mess to the south.
Kati has done a marvelous job at totally trashing this room since this morning. You swear there once was a bed in here but all you can see is a [mountain of clothing] in front of the [closet]. The hallway is to the north.
You are inside a windowless room constructed of rough-cut timber. There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with [cauldrons, books], a large [dusty] [table, pencil [sketches]], and assorted [equipment]. Large holes and splits in the ceiling provide more than enough light to make out that this is some type of crude laboratory. The only apparent exit is a [door] to the west.
Well as far as [closets] go, this one is filled floor to ceiling with various [clothing] articles, [shoes, and sundry]. You can leave this Mecca for moths to the north.
You are in a flat grassy area surrounded by [scrub pines] and large [granite boulders]. Purple and yellow [wildflowers] flourish in this area and the attendant [bees] are laden full with pollen and nectar. A lightly traveled path winds west through the [rocks].
A well-traveled path from the west branches south and continues east here under the refreshing [shade] of the bordering [oaks]. The sloping path leading south appears somewhat muddy but the footing does not appear to be too difficult.
You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town. Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures are to the west while a large barn-like building is due north. There is a faded [sign] just off to the side of the trail.
The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the east wall displays mere [remnants] of the grains, sugar, fruit, and candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The [shelves] behind the counter are now only a repository for dust and a [framework] for countless cobwebs. The wooden [floorboards], once sanded and polished, are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken [doors] leads out to the south and an open [screen door] leads to the west.
This small fenced-in area was once a garden, probably for the private use of the store's proprietor. Weeds now blanket the dark soil where once beans, carrots, potatoes, and the like thrived in the hot summer. In one [corner] of the garden, however, a single [corn stalk] has made its way skyward supported by the fence. A screen door to the east leads back into the store.
The east-west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore [trees] that look more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.
The upper branches of this [tree] are almost totally bare of [leaves]. One branch within reach supports a deserted bird's [nest] which looks a whisper away from nonexistence. Further travel up the [tree] does not look promising since, basically, there is no more [tree].
Abandoned [teller windows] line the west wall of this former financial hub of the Deadeye community. Not unlike everything else in town, it too has fallen into disrepair. To the north you can make out an open [vault] and to the south lies Main Street.
This red brick enclosure has been picked clean of its valuables, bringing to mind the adage "A Day Late, and a Dollar Short." A large [wooden table] dominates the center of the room supporting some type of [mechanical] [contraption]. The rest of the bank lies to the south.
This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, surprisingly, the wall-length [mirror] in back of the bar is still intact. The brass foot rail at the base of the bar is worn flat on the top from the countless patrons whose hard-earned wages were quickly converted into good times and song. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.
A briskly moving [stream] widens here and is shallow enough to cross without difficulty. Along one bank where the [water] slows to a crawl a deposit of [black magnetite] can be seen. The trail continues to the northeast and up a small ridge to the southwest.
It is difficult to discern the trail here due to the thick [sagebrush]. The vegetation does thin a bit to the southeast and southwest, and a clear path leads north.
You are just outside a large barn-like structure that appears to be the local livery. The aging structure looks fairly sound except that the roof is starting to sag in areas. Just north is an [oddly colored entrance] to the building. The rest of Deadeye is to the southwest and there is a clearing to the south.
This dilapidated building has long fallen into disrepair. It is surprisingly bright in here as light filters through large gaping holes in the roof. Numerous [stalls] line the walls presumably for [horses] or other livestock. A [wooden ladder] provides access to a hayloft to the north while large sliding doors, long off their rails, provide an egress to the east. You can leave the building by heading south.
All is not so 'O.K.' with this corral as most of the wooden fences have given away to the ravages of time and the elements. [Tall range grass] has overtaken the ground and the air is alive with the sounds of [grasshoppers], crickets and the like.
You are standing atop a large knoll which apparently served as a cemetery at some point in time. Remains of a [picket fence] lie strewn about the hillside and most of the [gravestones] have disintegrated beyond recognition. One granite [marker] at the head of a grassless [plot], however, remains intact.
A rather tall hill sprouts out of the landscape here, casting a deep shadow to the east. A well-traveled path leads up the hill to the northeast and a grassy trail leads off to the southeast. There is a [sign] lying in the dirt.
"I'm too old for this nonsense" is your first thought after a brief journey over the crest of the hill to this dirt outcropping on the north side. Momentarily ignoring your aching joints and brief memory lapses, you spot a trail heading south up the hill. Oddly, the trail shows signs of fresh [footprints].
Wisps of steam rise off of the [charred] timbers of what was once a fair-sized building. Small flames flare up occasionally producing a deep crackling sound. Paper-thin pieces of [ash] float hither and yon. An [odd-shaped sign] lies on the ground.
The ol' saloon is hoppin' tonight! [Dance girls] (ahem) swarm the dusty [patrons], encouraging them to drink and gamble amongst other indiscretions. Above all the whoopin' 'n hollerin', you can just make out the tinny ragtime of an unseen brass-tack piano. The [barkeep] is shoveling out drinks to the bar at a furious pace while one of the other hired help polishes the wall-length [mirror].
A small stream flowing from the west is only slightly hampered here by a deteriorating beaver dam which has formed a large deep pool of crystal clear water. [Chokecherry] [bushes] line the perimeter of the pool confining access to the pool to the area in which you are standing. The air is thick with [mosquitos and gnats].
The main trail surrenders here to thick brush and thicket making further progress impossible. A faded [sign] is nailed to a huge [willow tree] whose long narrow [branches] just touch the ground. You can pick up the main trail to the northwest.
The north-south path widens at the base of a steep rocky hill where an apparently large mining operation once stood. Another trail heads off to the east. Narrow gauge tracks come down a small knoll to the wide entrance [carved] into the hill. The entrance has been boarded over with thick [timber] and bears the notice "KEEP OUT" in crudely painted red letters. There is [sign] at the top of the entrance.
The path winds through thick bramble to a secluded clearing. In the middle of the clearing is a tall [wooden derrick]. Various debris is scattered around the [derrick], including a bent-up green and white [sign].
You are standing on a slat on the south face of the [derrick] just a few feet off the ground. Inscribed in one of the support beams just off to your left is the following:
You are standing on a slat on the south face of the [derrick] halfway between the top and the base. Scrawled on one of the cross members is the following:
You are just a few feet from the top of the [derrick]. One of the adjacent [slats] has the following painted on it:
Narrow gauge tracks come down a [small] knoll down to the wide entrance carved into the hill. A mass of broken [timbers] surround the base of the foreboding entrance to the west. There is a [sign] at the top of the entrance.
You are in a dark mine shaft. The tracks coming from the entrance to the east end here. On the tracks, you see an [ore car]. Up high in the roof of the shaft, there is a narrow dark opening. You can proceed west to go deeper into the mine or exit the mine to the east.
The shaft narrows here to a mere crawlway. There is a [small crack] in one of the walls.
The mine shaft opens here into a large chamber. Light streams in from a three-foot [hole] in the [ceiling]. Presumably, the [hole] was chiseled in the rock as a [vent] for the mine system. You can see the mine shaft to the east.
You are on a narrow platform at the very top of the [oil derrick]. The platform is spotted with a number of bird [droppings]. The view from here is mostly obstructed by trees, but you can make out the hill with the mine to the west.
This [small jail] was not designed for the comfort of its occupants. It is impossible to stand without hunching over and you can touch any two walls at the same time. The only relief from the crumbling stucco walls is the [iron-barred] [door] to the north.
The heat is stifling at this [barren] strip of track seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Even the ever present weeds have given up this area as hopeless and only a few cacti have managed to gain a foothold in the constantly shifting sand. One of the [rails] has become dislodged, forming a six-inch [gap] on one side of the [tracks].
Your makeshift railroad comes to an end here as several feet of sand cover the tracks. Right next to the tracks to the south is a [small sod structure] with a [faded sign] on top.
The far end of the canyon ends abruptly at this solid wall of sandstone which ascends over fifty feet from where you are standing. The trail winds around some scrub brush to a [pile of rocks] which rests against the face of the wall.
Water hasn't found its way down this rocky streambed for years by the looks of all the weeds and wildflowers growing between the rocks. A [grove of gatewood trees] with thick underbrush prevents any further progress west. There is a tunnel to the east with thick bramble at the entrance, and the path heading north along the streambed.
Progress up the stream bed is slow due to the large rocks and tall weeds. A large [gatewood tree] has fallen here and is well along its return to the elements. The path follows the streambed to the south and continues north to a small structure.
The streambed turn east here and vanishes into the thick bushes and weeds. To the west is an old run-down shack which looks several years past its prime. There is a [hitching post] just outside the [door].
The "[Biscuit] Residence" would hardly constitute a walk-in closet by your standards, but what it lacks in size is more than made up for by the charming decor of splintered [wood], dense cobwebs, and the occasional trail of mouse droppings. There is a small [wood stove] nestled in one of the corners, whereas in the opposite corner is a couple of bedrolls, saddles and other supplies. There are a [table] and a couple of chairs in the center of the room. In front of the [stove], you can just make out a good-sized rectangular [cutout] in the [wood] floor.
This low ellipsoidal [room] makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white [wall] is broken up only by the large [elliptical] [window] in the [ceiling] and the [circular [doorway]] through which you entered. A [cluster of forms] sits in the center, atop the slightly [concave] floor.
You're on a [hilltop] overlooking the seaside [village] of Festeron.
This is the [lobby] of the Festeron Post [Office]. The [walls] are lined with small, private [mailboxes] and wanted [posters]. A service [counter] runs along the entire length of the [room].
You're standing next to an open iron [gate] that leads west into the Festeron [Cemetery]. A [road] runs east to the top of Post Office [Hill].
You're in a creepy [corner] of the Festeron [Cemetery], surrounded by silent [tombstones]. An iron [gate] opens to the east, and a narrow [lane] wanders north.
A copse of willow [trees] makes this part of the [cemetery] look really spooky. Narrow [lanes] wander south and west.
The [trees] here are so thick, it's almost too [dark] to see! You can make out a closed iron [gate] to the north, and a narrow [lane] between the [tombstones] winds off to the east.
You're at the bottom of an open [grave], surrounded by six-foot [walls of dirt].
You're outside the [cottage] of Miss [Voss], the [town] librarian. The [road] turns north toward the [village], and bends upward to the summit of Post Office [Hill].
This is the south side of the Festeron [Rotary]. A [road] branches south, towards Post Office Hill.
You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Festeron [Rotary]. [Walks] converge from four [directions] on a shallow marble [fountain], filled with sparkling [water].
This is the northern side of the Festeron [Rotary]. A [road] leads north, towards the river.
This is the south side of a covered [bridge] that spans the Festeron [River]. [Paths] lead off to the east and west, and a [road] leads south to the [village].
You're on a covered [bridge] that spans the Festeron [River]. A [sign] hangs on an [arch] overhead.
This is the north side of the Festeron [Bridge]. Sheer [cliff walls] rise abruptly to the north and west. A [path] wanders east along the [shore] of the [river].
You're at the bottom of a [cliff] that rises up from the north [bank] of the [river]. A steep [trail] winds upward.
A steep, rocky [trail] winds west and downward.
You're standing high on a rocky [cliff], at the top of a steep [trail] leading downward.
You're in the front showroom of the Magick [Shoppe].
You're lost in a thick [cloud of fog].
This is where the [lake] empties into the Witchville [River]. A [road] leads south along the edge of the [lake], and bends east to follow the [river] bank. A narrow [trail] leads upward to the top of Lookout [Hill].
You're on the [sandy] [shore] of the [lake]. A [road] heads east towards the [village], and another runs north along the edge of the [lake]. Looking south, you can see a closed iron [gate] leading into the Witchville [Cemetery].
You're standing on a [fog]-shrouded [beach]. Sheer [cliff walls] rise to the north and south, and the [dark waters] of the [lake] stretch eastward.
You're standing in a long, high-[ceilinged] chamber. Hundreds of [platypuses] are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces illuminated by a roaring [fireplace].
You're in a [dark] underground chamber. Long [tunnels] wander away to the north and east, and there's a [dark hole] in the south [wall].
You're in a damp underground chamber. Long [tunnels] wander away to the north and west.
You're [locked] inside a damp, uncomfortable jail [cell]. Its thick steel [door] and stone [walls] offer little hope for escape.
Cold, [dark tunnels] wander away to the south, east and west.
You have stumbled into the [nesting] place of a family of [grues]. Congratulations. Few indeed are the adventurers who have entered a [grue's] [nest] and lived as long as you have.
You're in a smelly underground chamber. Cold [tunnels] wander away to the south and east.
You're standing at the summit of a high, barren [hill]. Looking east, you can see Witchville [Village] nestled among the trees. A narrow [trail] winds down the north side of the [hill], towards the river.
You're on a [rocky] [path] that runs east and west along the banks of the Witchville [River]. A shimmering [trail] leads south into a dense [forest].
You are standing in an open field west of a white [house], with a boarded front [door].
This is where the [river] empties into Witchville [Bay]. A [path] leads west along the [riverbank].
You're on the eastern side of the Witchville [Rotary]. A [street] branches off to the east, towards the bay.
You're standing in the [lobby] of the [movie theater]. A short [corridor] leads north into [darkness]. Sound effects and music can be heard drifting down the [corridor].
This is a [movie theater] unlike any you've ever seen! The [seats] are wide, deep and comfortable. The [aisles] are spotless. The air is clear of smoke, and the [screen] is dramatically large. A chill goes up your spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.
You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure [Wharf]. The [Wharf] extends eastward into Witchville [Bay].
This old [building] is the home of a sleazy [arcade], lined with coin-op video [games]. The [machines] are crowded with half-crazed, stunted [humanoids], who pay no attention to you as [they] satisfy their thirst for electric violence.
You're standing in a dimly-lit [vestibule] just inside the [tower's] [entrance]. The [drawbridge] is opened across the moat to the north. A short [corridor] leads south, into the [tower].
You're [chained] up in the corner of a dim, stuffy [chamber], deep within the bowels of the [tower]. The [walls] gleam with obscure medical [instruments], and a diabolical torture [machine] occupies most of the opposite corner.
You're in a round [chamber] at the very heart of the [tower]. The clammy [stone walls] are hung with a [series of paintings], all the same size and identically framed. Years of neglect have blackened the art almost beyond recognition.
The highest [room] in the [tower] is a [laboratory], complete with bubbling [chemicals] and foul odors. An antique [telescope] is mounted near an open [window] to the north, and a control [panel] occupies most of the south [wall].
This is the [cottage] of Miss [Voss], the former [town] librarian. The [walls] are lined with timeworn [books and dusty], faded [photographs]. Looks like nobody's lived here for a long time.
You're standing before a large [desk] at the [library] [entrance]. The top of the [desk] is almost hidden under a clutter of [books], all grey with [dust].
Formerly a popular tourist attraction, the old Festeron [Museum] is in a sorry state. Many of the best [exhibits] have been carted away; the few remaining are sorely in need of renovation.
You're standing dumbfounded and humiliated on the [stage] of the [Compass] Club. There's nothing left to do than to swallow your defeat and climb down the [stage].
This is the center of the [Compass] Club. Most [people] don't orient themselves in relation to [compass] directions, but here it's more than natural. A huge [compass rose] is painted to the [ceiling] and the abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.
The sharp [spotlights] in this southeastern [corner] of the club create [dark] and gloomy [shadows] around the [tables].
In this corner of the club there's a collection of [arcade machines]. This is where all the tough kids like to hang out.
The [people] who are performing in the club usually hang around here by the [stage].
A club wouldn't be a club if it didn't have a [bar]. The [selection of drinks] is written on a [chalkboard] behind the [counter] next to an [educational] [poster].
This area is reserved to those with VIP passes. There are [cushy red sofas] to sit on and you don't have to worry about drunken idiots crashing your [table].
Just being here makes your heart beat faster. The walls are adorned by [portraits] of past champions, each a part of great history.
If you ever get out of here, you really must complain to the prison's standards officers. This place is dirtier and dustier than a dirt factory. If you didn't have better things to do, you'd be in the right mind too give the place a jolly good clean just too spite it. There's a heavily built [door] to the south.
Another section of corridor that leads south into a room of some sort and west back towards your [old] cell.
The armoury is very sparsely stocked. If it where not for the bid red [sign] that proclaims "ARMOURY!" you'd probably guess it was just another cell...
Some kind of [control] room. Unfortunatly you fail to see a big [button] marked "Disable security devices"...Might have to be a bit more subtle.
A reasonably large hall with a [security camera] positioned to the far north. The [walls] are that inhumane stainless [steel] white that turns your brain to mush after looking at it for a while.
A lift. There's a [button] that says "Down" on it and also a door to the south.
This room is large administration office with two desks stacked with papers, which behind sit two office [workers], one [male] and one [female]. There are corridors emitting from this room in every [direction] and a [sign] on the [wall] that seems to explain where each of these corridors goes.
Finally, a bar! Somewhere to quench your thirst for a pint of smooth, creamy ale...Your mouth begins to dribble, until you realise you have no money to speak of.... Your heart sinks, and you pause to take in the surroundings. It looks rather like a 20th century wine bar, with [classy furnishings] well placed around the room. There is a large [sign] on the [wall].
Rather than an [officers] social hall, it appears to be a place of work. There is a [photocopier] stood on a [table] and a [smart looking officer] type sat behind the [desk].
Before you stands a [bulkhead door], looking every inch your ticket to freedom. Unfortunatly, it doesn't appear to have any method of opening. Back to the south you can see a large room, while to your east lies a small control room.
A small, dank control room, which only has the one [button]. An incredibly strange state of affairs for a control room, really. It's a big [button], if it helps.
There is a small [mailbox] here.
You are facing the north side of a white [house]. There is no door here, and all the [windows] are [boarded] up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.
This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low [branches] stands at the edge of the path.
Beside you on the [branch] is a small [bird's] [nest]. In the [bird's] [nest] is a large [egg] encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless [songbird]. The [egg] is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most [eggs], this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The [egg] appears extremely fragile.
You are behind the white [house]. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the [house] there is a small [window] which is slightly ajar.
On the [table] is an elongated brown [sack], smelling of hot peppers. A [bottle] is sitting on the [table]. The glass [bottle contains]: A [quantity of water]
You are in the living room. There is a [doorway] to the east, a wooden [door] with strange gothic [lettering] to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy [case], and a large oriental [rug] in the center of the room. Above the trophy [case] hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity. A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy [case].
This is a small room with [passages] to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an [axe]) mar the [walls]. A nasty-looking [troll], brandishing a bloody [axe], blocks all [passages] out of the room. The [axe] gets you right in the side. Ouch!
There are old [engravings] on the [walls] here.
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden [railing] which circles the dome.
This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble [pedestal]. A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head. Sitting on the [pedestal] is a flaming torch, made of ivory.
On the two ends of the [altar] are burning [candles]. On the [altar] is a large black [book], open to [page] 569.
This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending staircase to the west. The solid-gold [coffin] used for the burial of Ramses II is here.
This is a forest, with [trees] in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight.
Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a [painting] of unparalleled beauty.
The sluice [gates] on the dam are closed. Behind the dam, there can be seen a wide reservoir. [Water] is pouring over the top of the now abandoned dam. There is a control [panel] here, on which a large metal bolt is mounted. Directly above the bolt is a small green plastic [bubble].
Some [guidebooks] entitled "Flood Control Dam #3" are on the reception desk. There is a [matchbook] whose cover says "Visit Beautiful FCD#3" here.
You are in a large square room with tall ceilings. On the south wall is an [enormous] [mirror] which fills the entire wall. There are exits on the other three sides of the room.
You are outside a large [gateway], on which is inscribed
You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. In the corner are stacked the [remains] of dozens of previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north. Lying in one corner of the room is a beautifully carved crystal [skull]. It appears to be grinning at you rather nastily.
Beside the [skeleton] is a rusty [knife]. The deceased adventurer's useless [lantern] is here. There is a [skeleton] [key] here. An old leather [bag], bulging with [coins], is here.
This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up. A [cyclops], who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase. From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.
There is a folded [pile of plastic] here which has a small [valve] attached.
There is a slimy stairway leaving the room to the north. There is a hand-held air [pump] here.
Lying half buried in the mud is an old [trunk], bulging with [jewels].
You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the White [Cliffs]. There is a narrow path heading south along the [Cliffs] and a tight passage leading west into the [cliffs] themselves.
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous [waterfall] with a drop of about 450 feet. The only path here is on the north end. A beautiful [rainbow] can be seen over the falls and to the west.
You are on top of a [rainbow] (I bet you never thought you would walk on a [rainbow]), with a magnificent view of the Falls. The [rainbow] travels east-west here.
You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A [rainbow] crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest. At the end of the [rainbow] is a [pot of gold].
You are beneath the [walls] of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a narrow path.
You are on a [ledge] about halfway up the [wall] of the river canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable.
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the canyon, the [walls] of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with [rainbow]. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded [bags], which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor.
This is a dimly lit forest, with large [trees] all around.
This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters "Granite Wall" are etched in the rock. To the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal [slide] twisting downward. To the north is a small opening.
You are in a small room which has doors only to the east and south. In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large [vampire] bat who is obviously deranged and holding his nose. There is an exquisite jade [figurine] here.
This is a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft descending through the floor into darkness below. To the west and the north are exits from this room. Constructed over the top of the shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron [chain] is attached. At the end of the [chain] is a [basket].
This is a small room which smells strongly of coal gas. There is a short climb up some stairs and a narrow tunnel leading east. There is a [sapphire]-encrusted [bracelet] here.
This is a very small room. In the corner is a rickety wooden [ladder], leading downward. It might be safe to descend. There is also a staircase leading upward.
This is a rather wide room. On one side is the bottom of a narrow wooden [ladder]. To the west and the south are passages leaving the room.
There is a small [pile of coal] here.
This is a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken [timbers]. A wide passage comes from the east and turns at the west end of the room into a very narrow passageway. From the west comes a strong draft. There is a broken [timber] here.
This is a large, cold room whose sole exit is to the north. In one corner there is a [machine] which is reminiscent of a clothes [dryer]. On its face is a switch which is labelled "START". The switch does not appear to be manipulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4 inch). On the front of the [machine] is a large [lid], which is closed.
You are standing in front of a massive [barrow] of stone. In the east face is a huge stone [door] which is open. You cannot see into the dark of the [tomb].
You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end. A strangely familiar brass [lantern] is lying on the ground. A sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.
You are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent [mosses] clinging to its high ceiling. A deep [ravine] winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the [ravine] are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the [ravine] to the south.
A strange little [man] in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, [stringy], and unkempt beard. The Wizard draws forth his [wand] and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow. The Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Fear!" He cackles gleefully. You look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from [him].
You are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim [light] illuminates the cavern.
This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The [light] comes from a large growth of glowing [mosses] on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured [path] leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open [structure], painted white. It appears to be a [gazebo]. There is a large, white [animal] partly hidden behind some trees. Your [sword] has begun to glow very brightly.
Sitting on the [table] is:  A [matchbook] A china [teapot] A place [mat] A [newspaper] A letter [opener]
This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from [mosses] far above. The path is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west.
The path follows the south edge of a deep [ravine] and heads northeast. A tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. A faint whirring sound can be heard in that direction. On the east is a ruined archway choked with vegetation.
This is the southern end of a formal garden. [Hedges] hide the cavern walls and [mosses] provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped [hedges and bushes] are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the [bushes]: There is a dragon, a [unicorn], a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose [arbor] into a tunnel.
You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The [water] is very cold. The walls of the [ravine] rise to east and west. There is a small ledge along the north wall of the [ravine]. To the south is the entrance to a well-constructed but somewhat ruined hall.
You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep [ravine]. The ledge continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.
This is a tiny room carved out of the wall of the [ravine].
This is a small and rather dreary room, eerily illuminated by a red glow emanating from a [crack] in one wall. The light falls upon a dusty wooden [table] in the center of the room. On the south side of the room is a massive wooden [door], which has a small [window] barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the [door] frame. A [keyhole] lies within the lock. In the center of the [table] sits a blue crystal [sphere].
The room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell is very strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the west, through the room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south. To the east a small crack is visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads north. A huge red [dragon] is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his teeth.
The [dragon] seems to have lost interest in you. He [wanders] off. Your [sword] is glowing with a faint blue glow.
The room is cool and damp. The [air] is misty. A twisty [path] from the southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone [bridge], and a narrow westerly [tunnel]. It is from the latter that the mist and chill seem to originate.
Your [sword] is no longer glowing.
A rotten old wooden [chest] is in one corner among the debris. A beautiful young [woman], wearing a dirty and bedraggled gown, sits on a rock in the corner. Her hair is unkempt and she is oblivious to your presence, almost in a trance.
This is a large room which was evidently used once as a quarry. Many large limestone chunks lie helter-skelter around the room. Some are rough-hewn and unworked, others smooth and well-finished. One side of the room appears to have been used to quarry building blocks, the other to produce [menhirs] (standing [stones]). Obvious passages lead north and south. One particularly large [menhir], at least twenty feet tall and eight feet thick, is leaning against the wall blocking a dark opening leading southwest. On this side of the [menhir] is carved an ornate letter "F".
This is a damp circular room, whose [walls] are made of brick and mortar. The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be some [etchings] on the [walls]. There is a passageway to the west. There is a wooden [bucket] here, 3 feet in diameter and 3 feet high.
This is a small room containing a large oblong [table], no doubt set for afternoon tea. It is clear from the objects on the [table] that the users were indeed mad. In the eastern corner of the room is a small [hole] (no more than four inches high). There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest. There is a large oblong [table] here. Sitting on the large oblong [table] is:  A [cake] frosted with green [letters] A [cake] frosted with red [letters] A [cake] frosted with orange [letters] A [cake] frosted with blue [letters]
This is an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden [posts] delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to be a wooden roof. In fact, all objects in this room appear to be abnormally large. To the east is a passageway. There are large gaping chasms to the west and northwest. There is a china [teapot] here.
This is a large room, one half of which is depressed. Salty water flows from a large leak in the ceiling. The only exit is to the west. A stoppered glass [flask] with a skull-and-crossbones marking is here. The [flask] is filled with some clear liquid. The leak has submerged the depressed area in a [pool of tears]. There is a hazy something at the deepest part of the [pool].
You are in a circular room with a low ceiling. There are exits to the east and southeast. There is a green [piece of paper] here. There is a [robot] here.
This is a large room full of assorted heavy machinery, whirring noisily. The room smells of burned resistors. Along one wall are three [buttons] which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square. Naturally, above these [buttons] are instructions written in EBCDIC. A large sign in English above all the [buttons] says "DANGER -- HIGH VOLTAGE" There are exits to the west and the south.
You are trapped inside a solid steel [cage].
There is a [coil] of black, braided [string] here.
There is a large and extremely heavy wicker basket here. An enormous cloth [bag] is draped over the side and is firmly attached to the basket. A metal [receptacle] is fastened to the center of the basket. Dangling from the basket is a piece of braided [wire].
On the floor is a priceless [gold zorkmid] (a valuable collector's item).
An enormous cloth [bag] attached to the basket is inflated.
In it is a burning [newspaper]. A piece of [wire] tied to a hook holds the [balloon] in place.
A handsome [book], bound in green leather, sits in the center of the room. Right beside the purple [book] sits a white one. Worn and battered in one corner of the room is a blue [book]. Lying in the dust, and [covered] with mold, is a purple [book].
You are in a dusty old room which is featureless, except for an exit on the north side. Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty [box]. It appears to be somewhat damaged, since an oblong [hole] has been chipped out of the front of it.
On the ground is a small, worn [piece of paper].
A [portrait] of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
On the floor sit 200 neatly [stacked] zorkmid [bills].
A marble [stairway] leads down into the gloom and a passage leads north.
This is a room with oddly angled walls and passages in all directions. The walls are made of some glassy substance. A marble [stairway] leads upward.
On the floor is a very small diamond shaped [window] which is flickering dimly. A long wooden [club] lies on the ground near the diamond-shaped [window]. The [club] is curiously burned at the thick end.
On the floor is a very small diamond shaped [window] which is dimly glowing.
On the floor is a very small diamond shaped [window] which is glowing.
On the floor is a very small diamond shaped [window] which is glowing brightly.
This room is cobwebby and musty, but tracks in the dust show that it has seen visitors recently. At the south end of the room is a stained and [battered] (but very strong-looking) [door]. To the north, a corridor exits. Imbedded in the [door] is a nasty-looking lizard [head], with sharp teeth and beady eyes. The lizard is sniffing at you.
You are standing in the entry hall of the Wizard's Workshop. Dark corridors lead west and south from here. The corridor to the west smells slightly of incense or candle smoke. The workshop [door] is open.
This room is the Wizard's workroom. A hall continues east and west, and a larger room lies to the south. There are many shelves and racks on the walls, but the Wizard's [workbench] dominates the room. It is made of dark, heavy wood bound with iron. The [workbench] is stained from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about the [bench]; [alembics], mortar and pestle, small [knives] of various sizes, odd scraps of [vellum], wax [candles], and much more. In the center of a relatively clear area of the [bench] are affixed three [stands] - ruby, sapphire, and diamond - which form a triangle.
In this room, inscribed on the floor, is a great [pentagram] drawn with black chalk. In its center is a black [circle].
A gigantic dog [collar], large enough for three rhinoceros-sized dogs, is lying amidst the debris.
This is the entrance to a huge crypt or tomb. A marble [stairway] leads up from a gateway arch. There is a vicious-looking [dog] guarding the entrance. It is more or less your usual [dog], except that it has three heads and is the size of an elephant.
The room contains the earthly remains of the mighty Flatheads, twelve somewhat flat [heads] mounted securely on [poles]. While the room might be expected to contain funerary urns or other evidence of the ritual practices of the ancient Zorkers, it is empty of all such objects. There is writing carved on the [crypt]. The only apparent exit is to the north through the [door] to the anteroom.
Beyond the door is a roughly hewn staircase leading down into darkness. The landing on which you stand is covered with carefully drawn magical runes like those sketched upon the workbench of the Wizard of Frobozz. These have been overlaid with sweeping green lines of enormous power, which undulate back and forth across the landing. The [wand] begins to vibrate in harmony with the motion of the lines. You feel yourself compelled downward, and you yield, stepping onto the staircase. As you pass the green lines, they flare and disappear with a burst of [light], and you tumble down the staircase!
Your old friend, the brass [lantern], is at your feet.
You are west of the junction, where the [rock]-bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty [wall] of stone, ancient and crumbling. To the southwest the [wall] has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into [rocky] terrain to the northwest.
A rope is tied to one of the large [trees] here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below. It seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh [bread] lying beneath one of the other [trees].
This is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone [channel], wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with [moss and lichen], and is far too slippery to climb. The [channel] crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.
You are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north [wall] is ornately carved, filled with strange [runes] and writing in an unfamiliar language.
You are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone [steps] lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above.
You are floating on the [surface] of the lake. The [water] is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however.
Something sparkling in the [sand] catches your eye for a moment.
You are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the [water's] edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south.
You are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west. To one side of the room is a large manhole [cover]. The light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single [key] is lying in the dust.
You are in a wide stone [channel], part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the [aqueduct] to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.
You are now on one of the tallest [arches] of the [aqueduct], hundreds of feet above a rocky [chasm]. The immensity of the [aqueduct] project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive [arches], which traverse the region from north to south. The water-carrying [channel] here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the [aqueduct].
You are near the northern end of this segment of the [aqueduct] system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the [aqueduct] looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water [channel] drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp [moss and lichen] would certainly make that a one-way trip.
A long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the [cliff] and is within your reach. A large [chest], closed and locked, is lying among the [boulders].
You are at the shore of an amazing underground sea, the topic of many a legend among adventurers. Few were known to have arrived at this spot, and fewer to return. There is a heavy surf and a breeze is blowing on-shore. The land rises steeply to the east and quicksand prevents movement to the south. A thick mist covers the [ocean] and extends over the hills to the east. A path heads north along the beach.
You are in a shadowy land of low, rolling hills stretching out to the west and south. The land is bordered to the north by a massive stone [wall]. Ancient and weathered, the [wall] has crumbled enough at one point to permit passage.
You are standing at the southern end of a long, dimly lit hall. To the south, [stairs] ascend into darkness. To the north the corridor is illuminated by [torches] set high in the walls, out of reach. On one wall is a red [button].
You are in the middle of a long north-south corridor whose walls are polished stone. A narrow red [beam of light] crosses the room at the north end, inches above the floor. The corridor continues north and south.
This is a chamber of breathtaking beauty. Mighty [stalagmites] form structured shapes of rock, encrusted with [crystalline] formations. Phosphorescent [mosses], fed by a trickle of water from some unseen source above, make the [crystals] glow and sparkle with every color of the rainbow. There is an opening to the west, and a man-made passage heads south.
This is the north end of a large hall with a vaulted ceiling. A long, tiled hallway leads north through a tall arch. Although the origin or purpose of this room is unclear, there is a large [rendering] of the Royal [Seal] of Lord Dimwit Flathead carved on the wall.
This is the south end of a monumental hall, full of dust and debris from a recent earthquake. To the east is a great iron [door], rusted shut. To its right, however, is a gaping [cleft] in the rock and behind, a cleared area.
This is the entrance to the Royal Museum, the finest and grandest in the Great Underground Empire. To the south, down a few [steps], is the entrance to the Royal Puzzle and to the east, through a stone [door], is the Royal Jewel Collection. A wooden [door] to the north is open and leads to the Museum of Technology. To the west is a great iron [door], rusted shut. To its left, however, is a [cleft] in the rock providing a western route away from the museum.
Directly in front of you is a large golden [machine], which has a [seat] with a [console] in front. On the [console] is a single button and a [dial] connected to a three-digit [display] which reads 948. The [machine] is suprisingly shiny and shows few signs of age. A strange grey [machine], shaped somewhat like a clothes [dryer], is on one side of the room. On the other side of the hall is a powerful-looking black [machine], a tight tangle of [wires, pipes, and motors]. A [plaque] is mounted near the [door]. The writing is faded, however, and cannot be made out clearly. The two [machines] seem to be in bad shape, rusting in many spots.
You are in a high-ceilinged chamber in the middle of which sits a tall, round steel [cage], which is securely locked. In the middle of the [cage] is a [pedestal] on which sit the Crown [Jewels] of the Great Underground Empire: a [sceptre], a jewelled [knife], and a golden ring. A small bronze [plaque], now tarnished, is on the [cage].
(You are in the gold [machine].)
You are in a high-ceilinged chamber, in the center of which is a [pedestal] which is the intended home of the Crown [Jewels] of the Great Underground Empire: a jewelled [knife], a golden ring, and the royal [sceptre]. The room is, by appearances, unfinished. Through the [door] you can hear [voices] which, from their sound, belong to military or police personnel.
This appears to be an unfinished entranceway to the Royal Museum. There are [doors] to the east and north, and a blind stairway to the south. A heavy iron [door] to the west is closed and locked.
The grey [machine], it turns out, is a Frobozz Magic [Pressurizer], used in the coal mines of the Empire. The black [machine] is a Frobozz Magic Room Spinner. The golden [machine] is referred to as a [Temporizer]. All are non-working models donated by Frobozzco president John D. Flathead.
On the [console] is a single button and a [dial] connected to a three-digit [display] which reads 776.
This is a small square room, in the middle of which is a perfectly round hole through which you can discern the floor some ten feet below. The place under the hole is dark, but it appears to be completely enclosed in rock. In any event, it doesn't seem likely that you could climb back up. Exits are west and, up a few [steps], north. Lying on the ground is a small [note] of some kind.
You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with marble [walls] and to the east and south with sandstone [walls].
Somewhat to the north, identical stone [statues] face each other from pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor. The [statues] represent [Guardians] of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage. They are portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped around formidable bludgeons. The south side of the room is divided by a wooden [wall] into small hallways to the southeast and southwest.
Somewhat to the south, identical stone [statues] face each other from pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.
You are in a north-south hallway which ends, to the north, at a large wooden [door]. The corridor continues south. The wooden [door] has a barred panel in it at about head height. The [door] itself is closed.
The [dungeon] [master] is quietly leaning on his [staff] here.
There is an [object] here which looks like a [sundial]. On it are an [indicator] [arrow] and (in the center) a large [button]. On the face of the [dial] are numbers 1 through 8. The [indicator] points to the number 1. To the south, across a narrow corridor, is a prison cell.
You are in a featureless prison cell. You can see an east-west corridor outside the open wooden [door] in front of you. Your view also takes in the [parapet], and behind, a large, fiery [pit]. The dungeon [master] is standing on the [parapet], leaning on his wooden [staff]. His keen gaze is fixed on you and he looks somewhat tense, as if waiting for something to happen. Behind you, to the south, is a bronze [door] which is closed.
You are in a bare prison cell. Its wooden [door] is securely fastened, and you can see only flames and smoke through its small window. On the south wall is a bronze [door] which seems to be closed.
You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist-high [tunnel] that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire.
You are in a narrow [tunnel] whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent [boulders]. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the [tunnel] gradually widens.
This imposing ante-room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period." With leering [gargoyles], cartoonish [friezes] depicting long-forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive [statuary] of pointy-headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn [inscription] "Convention Center." To the east, under a fifty-story triumphal [arch], a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive [sign] (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post-Dimwit) [path] leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."
You are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of [paint] through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long-abandoned, loud, low-pitched sounds emanate from the [door] standing open to the north. Next to the [door] is a [sign], and to the [sign's] left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.
You find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd-looking [salesman] sits behind the [counter], his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you. A [notice] on the [counter] points toward a small, curtained room to the north.
It is obvious from the array of [body suits, masks, and gloves] heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A [mirror] hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.
You are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the "adventurer famine" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, "Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?" All around you, [grues] are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.
This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 [seats], not including the royal box [seats] that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The [seats] themselves are built like [thrones], with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.
The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.) As such, it sports a large, maroon [curtain] leading backstage and a row of brightly colored [footlights]. [Rubble and debris] block the ways to the wings, and a set of [stairs] leads back down into the theater's main aisle.
A thick, maroon [curtain] separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as [scrims, scenery and costumes litter] the floor.
Compared to the grandeur of the other parts of the Cultural Center, the Hall of Science is rather austere, serving mainly as the entrance to three smallish rooms, at the openings to which stand small [reader-boards]. These say "MUSEUM OF ILLUSIONS!" (east), "SEE THE MUD FORUM!" (south), and "MUSEUM OF ADVENTURE!" (west). The larger area to the north is the Cultural Center.
This large, [square] chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a [Multi]-User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better-socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a [sign] reading, "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" overlays another [sign], beneath which is a [sealed door]. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large [symbols] have been painted in royal purple; a large [display unit] with a heavy wooden [cover] stands behind.
The Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great [Implementers] - figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted [porcelain busts] of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these [busts], that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely-wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of [Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn], bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.
This museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the [Adventurer]. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your [spine]: A [skeleton]. On the small [pedestal] beside it sits a [plaque]. The [walls] have been clawed, the [wallpaper] and exhibit [signs] shredded by what was probably an over-excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, [piles of bones] lie on the floor, cracked open, fang-marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One [sign] on the [wall] by a [door] to the southwest remains, though.
As you step through the doorway, you realize you've entered a room so vast, you can see the distant curvature of the Earth. On the distant, foggy horizon, the [ceiling] appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are [shelves, shelves] and more [shelves], all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.
This area was designed for some otherworldly visitors, and judging by the sounds emanating from the many passages heading off to the east, they're still around. Dangling on the [bars] is a small [sign] which reads, "EXTRATERRESTRIAL MUSEUM."
Crisscrossings of muddy footprints head in from the door to the south, going northwest around the back of the [newsroom set], and east into the dimly-lit clutter of worn-out equipment and props. Directly ahead of you, [bundled snakes of cables and wires] lead into the [eye-mangling glare] of the [set] itself. Overhead hang the [racks] of studio [lights]. [Spiral stairs] go up to the [catwalk rigging].
Sheez, it's slippery up here. The woven black iron grille of the [catwalk] isn't providing much traction, now that it's spattered with [rainwater], which is coming down in goblike droplets and streams, seemingly from everywhere, spattering off the [rigging] and the [lamps], and running in curvy trickles down the insulated wiring.
You're of [two] minds about this. One is that it is absolutely crazy to be crouching here on top of the burning [lamps] themselves, the other is that it's really exciting and interesting, something you never get to see. Particularly thick rivulets of [water] cascading over the backs and faces of burning hot [lamps], breaking into sparks of color and [light].
The Treehouse is about six feet long and two foot wide, plenty of space to walk or sit, but the rain is making it treacherous. The joist plank is normally stable even out at the far unspported end, but today it feels like it has more spring to it. Maybe the humidity made it flexible or something, but a good bounce on it and it'd start oscillating like a diving board [right] now. It also feels slicker under your boots than usual -- probably all the oil from a dozen years of mayonnaise-laden sandwich drippings is floating to the surface. [Below] is the catwalk, and under that is the [lighting grid], its [cables] snaking up to [J-hooks] in the [ceiling] and down the back wall, just within reach of here.
Where all old studio [junk] goes to die. You've looked through this stuff before, trying to find something that'd even clear a few bucks at a yard sale, but management caught you at it and declared every piece of crap here to be off-limits private property. There's a [jug of fertilizer] and a [feather boa] here. Yeah, whatever.
Nothing to see here but a dank corridor of padded [gray] walls, like the inside of an asylum, which as far as you're concerned, it is. A locked [door] marked "[Maintenance] [Staff] Only" (that's you) lies north, and the [glare] of the [studio] is back to the southeast.
This is your home, your domain, where things are supposed to go where you can always find them again: cleaning supplies, the [gear rack], and the [shelves of plastic tubs].
You're starting to feel a little better about the state of things in your little home base here. The cleaning supplies are neatly in the [corner].
All the [tools] are hanging from the [gear rack].
Everything is sorted into the proper [plastic] tub. In fact, you feel a sense of peace and serenity flowing over you as you look at how spiffy everything is again. Ahh. That was well worth doing after all. Maybe you can even deal with the task at hand.
Ah, your home, your domain. Everything in order, unlike every other square foot of this place. Just being in here makes you feel a little better about everything. Cleaning supplies are in the [corner, tools] are hanging from a [gear rack], and everything else is organized neatly into [plastic tubs].
Your mind flashes on [three] things: the J-hooks, the fat snake cable, the suitcase ... ! In desperation, you grab --
Where's the tunnel of light? There's no tunnel of light. Your life didn't even flash before your [eyes]. There's just darkness, and a cold, hard floor under your back.
You can see nothing. There is nothing. Or -- funny thought -- maybe it's just that your [eyes] are closed?
A [steady drip], small and distant, echoes and expands to describe an endless space. Behind you is nothing. Before you, crawling from the darkness to the [left] and sliding on to the oblivion of the [right], is an infinite, silver [river]. You [mistook] it for a lake, so slowly does it flow, so smoothly unrippled is its surface. You cannot see the far side, as a veil of curdling, curlicuing [mist] hides everything beyond a stone's throw in a milky [haze].
The [river] flows around you. [Death] stands aft, using his [scythe] as a [rudder]. You are at the [prow], staring into the [mist].
Your [ferry boat] rocks [gently] against the [wooden dock]. [Ropes] tie it off and park it in the [bobbling] [water], in a busy and tangled [marina of hundreds] of such [vessels]. You seem to have gotten the no-frills ride, as the [largest] of the other [ships] is a [king's navy yacht], with [gold trim] on its [topside rails], gleaming [brass cannonade], and what looks like a [snack bar]. Of the other [vessels], even the least of its cousins -- not counting yours -- is [ornamented] specific to a different [culture].
Like the entrance to a theme park, if such things floated in the [clouds] as they do in the imagination of a child. A broad [plaza], open [above] to the [sky], and ringed by a [zen garden] of smooth pale [stones], raked into [parallel lines] that follow the circular curve of the [plaza]. In the center is an [inlaid carving] of a [compass rose], 14 feet across, with a [triangular] [spike] like a sundial whose [shadow] always points north, no matter how long you stare at it.
In the center is an [inlaid carving] of a [compass rose], 14 feet across. In the center of the [inlaid rose] is an exposed [patch of dark soil] where the [triangular] [spike] used to stand.
A broad [plaza, floating] in a [cloud] and open [above] to the [sky], now ringed by a [garden] of stout, vertical evergreens whose roots are enshrubbed and [flowered].
Lifeless grass lines the edges of a slippery frozen creek. A [bridge] over the creek leads east to a [farmhouse]. [Dark woods] lie to the southeast.
Casting warm light on the pale blue [snow], the small [farmhouse] looks closed up for the winter evening. Through the windows you can see some amount of activity. The scent of woodsmoke nearly obscures what your hunger allows you to pick up -- the smells of supper being prepared.
At the [outskirts] of a village, you pause to rest a moment in the rows of a vineyard, [snow]-covered and bare in the winter months. A fierce wind howls at your back, but perhaps it will give you just enough strength to move you the last few steps. There are lights just ahead to the east, and the smell of baking bread.
The road is clotted with deep [snow], and a fog rolls in as you progress, making you lose your sense of familiarity with the landscape. You halt at what seems to be like a dead end, as memories of a different existence are suddenly opened within your mind.
The [plaza], ringed by a garden of [stout], vertical [evergreens] whose roots are enshrubbed and [flowered], now seems lifted higher into the open [sky] and nearer to the [floating gate above] it. The [compass rose] at its center is buckled along its petal [carvings], sporting green shoots and grasses between every crack. The triangular spike has been swallowed completely by the trunk of a great alabaster tree, which has grown not just upward but outward, providing a leafy canopy and a good deal of shade.
Blinded by the [glare] of the [studio lights], heating you to a sweltering degree [from above], you can barely make [out] the tittering [studio audience] sitting in [bleachers] up to the rafters. Your feet are nailed to your [mark] on the floor, [right] next to the high-rise [desk from] which a [dark-suited] [host] looks down at you over the tops of his round spectacles.
The great [tree] has grown to overtake nearly the entire breadth of the [plaza], its vast maze of [branches] creaking and waving in the wind, straining at greater height. Three great threads of [stone], metal, and darker wood weave and wind up the [bark], having somehow grown into or along with the [tree].
The [stalks of grass] are dried golden brown now, waving in the hot breeze.
The other harvesters are bringing the reapings in from the fields and emptying their collections into piles. Two [women] sit crosslegged near the edge of the [threshing] floor, [stacking] [bundles of wheat tips] that they have neatly tied.
The pile of chaff is not endless, but it goes on and on, the way a waste landfill does. Parts of it are on fire, not in flames but just smoldering, giving off toxic fumes. At the far end to the north, a [great oven] is being prepared and stoked. The chaff will all be burned.
The [great oven] is the size of seven huts, made of clay bricks and sandstone. At the edges it is a sinister cherry [red], but near its belching, windy core it is yellow and fire [white]. To the north is the long road home.
The great [tree] reaches a height beyond mortal ken, higher than the [gate] that used to float in an open [sky], now looking -- distantly -- like the tiny top deck of a [treehouse]. The trunk of the [tree] appears to have fossilized, being as [stone], the same [stone] that formed a third of the [triangular] [spike], and now [carved] in a [spiral] around the circumference and leading up into the [branches] of the [tree]. Higher up, the [tree] shines in the light, glinting like metal, the trunk made of [bronze] and its shimmering [leaves] made of [gold]. Beyond that, you cannot tell from here.
You are here before a [great bronze door] decorated with [bronze] filagree and gold leaf. Around it an [archway of stone], 80 feet high and 25 feet wide, [carved] into which are [figures] from [history and myth], frozen in their moment.
The [base] of the [iron column] is a set of interlocking bars, triangled and latticed, reinforced with lateral beams as tall as your body. An opening in the front side leads into a space in the center of the [column].
Inside the base of the column is an octagonal platform, ringed by a grille of bars that arch overhead to form a flat peak, from which antiquated gearwork is connected to a set of chains and cables that reach up into the vertical darkness. A [sconce] hangs down below it, [scorched and sooty].
An octagonal platform, at the center of which is an inlaid compass rose. A grille of bars that arch overhead to form a flat peak, from which antiquated gearwork and a [sooty sconce] hang. Exits lead in each of eight directions.
Under a clear midnight sky, the stars twinkle and sparkle, millions and billions in a milky band of diamonds. The air is exceptionally clear, and the [river] captures and dancingly reflects the heavens within it.
The northern sun is low and pale, hidden by a smear of gray clouds over a green sea that washes with great crashes on the rocks far below. On an outcropping of rock at the jagged edge of a windswept fjord, a gnarled [ash tree], ancient and bent, makes its stand against the elements.
The [gate] of a great walled city, of alabaster towers and standards flying in the winds, a [gate] shining under a golden sky, glinting and sparkling. A [gate] of lapis and jade, pearl and silver, emerald and garnet, platinum and elecrum.
There is no up or down, or in or [out], or side to side, or alive or dead, or vision or blindness, or health or sickness. Neither darkness nor light. A seething ruin, a boiling of time, a crazed stir of constant annihilation, the end result of infinite entropy, neither beginning nor end.
Red rocks ribboned with gray and [orange] chalamite, bands of olive trees, [white] temples of marble, a blue sky, a green river. Ambrosia and nectar, wine and honey. Lazing and dancing and playing in the sunshine are a curvaceous company of [vixens and nymphs], shrieking with the utter gaiety of youth at play.
A vast arid stretch of soil and sharp rocks, endless in all directions, baked by the [sun] all day and [starved] with cold at night. It's currently nighttime.
The [sky] has halted. It's currently daytime.
A lush garden, a young rainforest, all the [trees] and flowers are new under the sun, yellow-green and [tender], bursting with fragrance and juice and sap, overflowing with [life]. You can seemingly watch it all grow, as if in a time lapse, [every blade] of grass straining upwards, reaching for the sunlight, exhaling oxygen so thickly that the [sky] seems [pink] and gold even under a high sun.
The ground is hard and dusty, though patched with thirsty-looking grass. There are weeds and nettles growing everywhere, spiky and angry looking shrubs, and trees with a bad look about them. To the west stand the twin [guardians] of Eden, barring entrance to the garden.
You look around, and panic. Get me [out] of here!
You are sitting on your [chair] in "Argentina" -- a workshop room at BiCon 2010. It is a modern university meeting room, small and bland, suitable for anything. The [door] is north; on the [wall] next to it are a couple of [posters].
A dull corridor extends east. A [door] on the south side says "[Argentina]" and another to the north declares "[Britain]".
Skylights in the [ceiling] of this meeting room pour [sunlight] over the Naked [Lunch], a large indoor [picnic]; there's even a [blanket] on the floor. [Picnickers] around the room are in varying states of nakedness, from T-shirt-and-undies down to not a stitch. The [door] is south.
A dull corridor runs west-east. There's a [door] to the north labelled "[Canada]" and a matching one south named "[Denmark]".
Welcome to the [Fun] & [Games] workshop! The way [out] is north.
The [Fun] & [Games] workshop has finished.
Another dull corridor. You could be in a hallway in any modern university building in the country. A yellow "BiCon 2010" [sign] points north, a [blue] one west and a [green] one northwest.
Ah, [reception], where [tea]-hungry [volunteers] guide and edify confused BiConners. They are sitting behind a [long desk], covered in [paperwork]. A [lost property box] sits on the [desk]. The main entrance [outside] is south, and the workshop rooms are somewhere west. The ballroom lies north.
A large [green space], surrounded by [blocks of student flats]. Yours is south from here; the main [entrance] to the [university] is north.
You haven't had time to stamp any personality on your [bedroom] yet. It contains a [bed], a [sink] and a [wardrobe] and not much else. The [door] to the rest of the flat is west.
This self-catering student flat is like [every] other you've ever stayed in, and is in danger of giving you flashbacks to your own university days. The front [door] is north and your study-[bedroom] is east.
The [band] is tight around your [arm] and the [bottle of cocaine] promises a few moments of relief. Nothing else matters.
Your rooms in [Baker Street] have always proven quite satisfactory. Neither the smell of your chemical experiments nor the sound of your midnight [violin] sessions draw any complaint, and yet you live near enough the heart of London to draw a diverse, often strange clientele. More important, the [window] overlooks the [street], allowing you to observe your clients before they reach your [door]. Your [desk, bookcase], and overflowing [box] of files from recent cases all testify to your efforts to collect [every] possible scrap of useful information about crime.
You are on the first floor landing of your lodging-house at 221b Baker Street. The [door] to your office is to the east, and the exit to the street is downstairs.
The neighbourhood of [Baker Street] is just waking up as its residents depart for work. The [street] is lined for [blocks] by flat-fronted [houses and apartment]-buildings of brown [brick], some of which have [storefronts] on the ground floor. [Hackney carriages] and pedestrians pass by on the flagstone [streets]. The door to your lodgings is north.
You are in the passenger [cabin] of the moving hackney [carriage]. The floor shakes as the [carriage's] wheels bounce over the uneven streets. The [wooden bench] looks uncomfortable, but you can't stand up straight in the [cab]. You can see the [cabbie] through a window at the front of the [taxi], and the [door] is to the west.
You can see [Wiggins and Inspector Lestrade] here.
The lower [bank] is a [muddy] mess after last night's rain. [Lestrade] and his underlings track their way across is as they make measurements and mutter about safety hazards. To the southeast is a dock where labourers load cargo onto a ferry, and a road leads north among warehouses. You can also go back up the hill to the west to return to the [bridge].
Waterloo [Bridge] extends south here some forty feet above the [Thames]. Traffic clatters past in [both] directions. The muddy bank slopes downward to the ferry stages, where Openshaw met his fate.
Leicester Square has a more casual feel than Trafalgar due to its smaller size, preponderance of grassy space, and lack of any major monuments. A marble [fountain] forms the square's centrepiece, and the [Alhambra Theatre] dominates its east side. To the southeast is the [International] [Hotel].
The spacious lobby is being repainted and plastered with [posters] for a new play. The [doors] east to the [stalls] are locked shut. The hallway to the business office is south, and the exit to the street is west.
Little more than a nook in the corner of the ticket booth, the business office is full of stacks of [receipts] and old [bank statements]. In the centre of the chaos is [Amelia Gertz], who calculates figures furiously on a [sheet of paper].
The [hallway] is hemmed in by the [plywood backdrop] for the next play, which has apparently not yet had [doorways] cut into it, because there is no way to pass around or through it onto the stage. No-one is working here at present, but [toolboxes and ladders] suggest that the carpenters will eventually return. The [hallway] continues east.
During productions, this would be the area where the cast waits to go on stage, but for the moment the only exit is the cramped passageway west. [Clippings and programmes] from past shows adorn the [wall], and over a [makeup table] you see several [pages pinned] to the [wall]. Aside from the [makeup] on the [table], there are [costume] clothes in a [chest] in the far corner.
You can see the [makeup] desk in front of you, and the [manifesto]. You can see nothing else, because you are facing the [wall].
The [basement] gives the impression of a well-run [criminal] enterprise. At one workplace, well-illuminated by [gaslights], a [small printing press] sits ready to be used for [criminal] deeds. Another, darker, corner holds [barrels] and a [painting] obviously placed to cover the hole in the [wall] leading to the International Hotel. A [small], bearded [man] with a [visor] on his head looks up at you, distracted from tracing some figure on a [printing plate] in front of [him].
At the centre of the massive Square is a [monumental] [pillar] topped by a [statue of Admiral] Horatio [Nelson]. Around the base of the [pillar] leisurely clusters of [tourists and pedestrians] wander, and around them is a massive [traffic circle]. One particularly [obnoxious sailor] loudly propositions a [barmaid], drawing scandalised [stares] from passers-by. You can reach Leicester Square and the Alhambra by walking around and past the [National Gallery], to the north.
The [bottom] floor of Scotland Yard has the appearance of an efficient workplace. Uniformed [Bobbies] wander through on their way to their patrols while [detectives] in buttoned [shirts and suspenders] sit at [desks] in the middle of the floor and try to concentrate on the important work.
This work area houses more [desks], which are used mostly by plainclothes [inspectors]. The [room] is mostly deserted, but [Lestrade] is here, writing up his safety [report] about the [Waterloo] ferry-stages. The armoury is to the west, and stairs lead down to the rest of the building.
This is the room where Scotland Yard keeps the [clubs and firearms] carried by its officers. Little more than a closet, the armoury is dominated by [racks and shelves], as well as [kegs of gunpowder].
You are surrounded by black, [cold water] in [every] direction.
The room is quite orderly and spotlessly clean, with white walls and metal [furniture]. Almost clinical. Not surprising knowing the work done here. The work [bench] is against the north wall, a simple slab of grey metal. The only other thing that breaks the emptiness is the [edge] of the [emergency panel] on the wall. The [elevator door] is south, and the test area in the eastern part of the room. The [blast door] is west.
The [specimen's] [cage] occupies most of the east wall. There is also a [cabinet] and the [disposal chamber].
Everything here is shrouded by a faint green light. Around you are orderly stacked hundreds and hundreds of [cylinders], piled so high that by looking up you can't see where they end. It reminds you of a tomb... The only empty [wall] is on the east, with what seems to be a [door] in it.
This room is [small] but serves its purpose well. The floor is carpeted with a soft green rug and the [walls] are mostly bare except for a [painting] depicting a lush [pastoral] scene. A [window] set in one [wall] gives a beautiful [view] of the [city]. The main living room is to the east and your [bathroom] is to the south.
The [bathroom] is painted that soothing institutional green color and the floor is covered with cream white tiles. Other than that it is furnished with all the usual fixings.
This large room serves as the main area to your apartment. The [walls] are bare and painted an unobtrusive shade of white. The floor is covered from [wall] to [wall] with a light beige carpet. To the west lies your bedroom, to the east is a [small] kitchen area and the front [door] is to the north
This small area serves as a kitchen area. The [walls] are done in a nice teak coloring and the floor is covered in smooth yellow linoleum. Considering that you either eat out, or order in most of the time, you rarely ever see this room. The living room lies to the west.
This [space], barely wider than outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw and square from unfinished [stone]. Only the floor is [smooth] -- a fine [white surface] beneath your feet. There is a [narrow gap] in the east [wall].
You are standing in a [short] windowless [hallway]. To the east is the foot of a [flight of stairs], which rises out of sight. To the west, the [hallway narrows], ending in a [small gap] of a [doorway].
You [stand] amid [clutter, oddments, shelves and stacks]. The [chamber] is comfortably broad, centered around a [massive and well-worn] [wooden desk]. But so much is jammed in, around the [desk] and up the [panelled] [walls], that you barely find [room] to [stand]. [Books]; [papers]; [dried plants]; [animals stuffed and preserved, antique instruments], [candles] of any hue. You don't recognize half of it, and you can't name half the rest.
This [room] seems more inviting. The [walls] are [painted] with [delicate patterns of flowers], which merge into a soft-hued [carpet] beneath your feet. Two [chairs] and a [cushioned settee face] a bright-flickering [fireplace] on the far wall.
You are in a high, dim corridor, [walled] in [cracked and moldering plaster]. The only light comes from [tiny flickering] [candles above]. The [hall] curves gently around from the south to the northwest. You see an open [door] to the west; archways open to the northeast and east.
The [curving] corridor ends here. The blank [plaster wall] to the south features a large [window]; [sunlight] pours in, brightening this end of the [hall]. You can go through the archway to the east, take the closed [door] to the west, or return north along the corridor.
This [room] looks like nothing so much as a small, windowless [garden shed]. The floor is [bare dirt]; the [walls] are [unfinished] [planks]. The only light falls in through the archway to the west. A narrow opening to the north leads to a steep stairway, which climbs away into darkness.
The [cramped stair] reaches a [landing] here; it reverses and continues upward to the south. The [walls] are close and dark.
The [cramped stair] reaches a [landing] here; it reverses and continues upward to the north.
You stand at the foot of a [low rocky] [cliff]. It squats [above] you, but it obscures little of the [vast blue sky] that stretches all around. [Mossy boulders] hem you in on either side; a [tidy path] winds to the south between them. To the north the [path] enters a [crack] in the [cliff], meeting [stairs] which vanish down into enclosed darkness.
A [tiny pleasance-garden] is nestled here, high on a [mountainside]. [Odd bits of statuary] stand among the sculpted [slopes and hillocks]; [small marble pillars] mark the borders of the [knotted [paths]]. The [lawn] is perfectly [trimmed]. The [mountain] towers [above] you to the north; high on its [face] you see a [featureless] [white dome]. [Above] that, the [sun] shines in a [wide blue mountain's] [sky].
You stand on a [small promontory] which juts out of the [face] of the [mountain]. [Shrubs] and raised [flowerbeds] lie around you, except for the path which [slopes] down to the west. To the south and east, a sharp dropoff looks out over a [lush green valley].
This corner of the garden is cozily tucked into a natural alcove, surrounded by [stone bluffs] on three sides. The [sun] is [hot] on your [face]. To the south, the ground drops away, revealing a [lush valley] far [below]. The path back to the garden curves up around an [outcropping] to the east.
The [air] is warm and dry.
Below this gently curved [balcony], the world drops away into a [green vista]. The stony [slopes] of the [mountainside] beneath you crumble, invaded by [bracken and tree], until the [mountain pines] merge into [verdant forest] and a [lush valley] floor. A [bright thread] marks a [stream]; a distant [valley lake] is a [silver arc]. Beyond the [valley], and around it, taller [mountains] stand like patient shadows in the [blue air].
The [walls and ceiling] of this room are entirely covered with [tiny blue tiles]. On the east wall, a few [black and grey tiles] seem to depict [birds] on the [horizon] of a [mosaic sky]. The only exit is an archway to the west.
This cramped, boxy [room] appears to have been an artist's [studio]. The [walls] and floor are [splattered] with [paints] of many [colors]. Strangely, the [room] is nearly empty; you see no stacks of canvas or bottles of [pigment].
You are in a dark [culvert] of some kind. The curving [walls] are polished [metal], antique with [tarnish]. To the south, the [channel] ends in a [circular glass barrier]; to the north, it opens out into light.
Jagged [mountains] tear the skies in [every] direction. They are unreal, impossible [peaks] -- knife-like [spires of rock]. But in this sheltered nook, life flourishes. A [small mossy] [pool, cool and shadowed] with [tiny fish], has gathered [below] a [[rock]-spr]ing.
A stark desert is spread in [every] direction. The [harsh grit] beneath your feet is littered with [dusty] [stones, small and large]. The [sun] is a [red glare] on the [horizon], turning the world to strokes of scarlet, rust, and shadow.
You are in the midst of a choppy, heaving [sea]. Impossibly, you stand balanced upon the milk-[white waves]. You can see no land in any direction.
The dingy [plaster walls] of this corridor curve out of sight to the west and southeast. [Tiny candles] provide the only illumination. Archways lead north and northeast.
This is a narrow passageway, which winds between irregular stone [walls] into the world's underdarkness. The passage was clearly not carved by human hands. Creamy [limestone] laps and drips in ancient, water-worn folds. The archway to the south is the only source of light; the passage vanishes into [cave-blackness], somewhere to the north.
You are somewhere within utter [darkness], somewhere within the earth.
It is [dark], as [dark] as you could imagine -- a [lightless] dream beneath stone.
You are in the unchanging, unleavened [darkness] of the world below ground.
The world is picked out, not in shades or tints or degrees of [black]; but in qualities of [darkness]. [Each] has a name; [each] whispers to you.
You stand at the east edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the west, arching into an [immense dome]. A diffuse illumination spreads across the lower reaches, barely [bright] enough to see by.
You stand at the north edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the south, arching into an [immense dome].
You stand at the west edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the east, arching into an [immense dome].
You stand at the south edge of a vast round space. It stretches out to the north, arching into an [immense dome].
You stand at the center of a vast round space. An [immense dome] arches [above] you.
An [immense dome] arches [above] you; it is filled with [white] light.
The [dome] is filled with tumbling bubbles, [each] surrounded by a whirling cloud of [gold] light.
The [dome] is filled with shapeless blobs of red light -- [each] filled with [smaller] speckles and spots. The blobs flow slowly across the [dome], like droplets of red wax in a hot sea.
The [dome] is filled with [familiar stars].
You are in a [small] round [dome]. The curving surface is [translucent], [bright] with the daylight filtering in from outside. The floor beneath your feet is a [harsh metal grating]. The [ladder] runs from a hole in the [grating], near the south side, up to a matching opening in the [dome above].
This railless [catwalk] circles the outer edge of a pale [dome]. You stand at the southern edge of the circle; the [catwalk] disappears around the [dome] to the east and west. A few [iron steps] lead up to an [opening] in the [dome], from which a [ladder] descends inside.
You are at the western edge of a [catwalk] which circles a pale [dome]. The [dome] rises from the [face] of a [sunlit] [mountain peak], which towers to the north. To the south, the stone [slopes] descend to a [wide valley], shining [green] in the afternoon light.
You stand on a [narrow], railless [catwalk], which girdles the [translucent] [dome] to the south. To the north, the [mountain] rises massively [above] you. But the [dome] stands on its own promontory; the [mountain face] is several yards away. The [ravine] between [dome and mountain] is [deep and jagged].
You are at the eastern edge of a [catwalk] which circles a pale [dome].
To the south, the stone [slopes] fall to a [verdant valley].
The curving surface is [translucent]; the light outside seems to be shifting rapidly.
This railless [catwalk] circles the outer edge of a pale [dome], which is illuminated from within.
You are standing at the end of a [long, black] tongue of [shadow] which hangs incomprehensibly in empty [air]. The [strip of darkness] bridges a [deep ravine] between a [fire-lit dome] to the south, and the [cliff-face] of a towering [mountain], to the north.
The curving surface is [translucent], but unlit; the world outside seems to be dark.
This is a [small], curved alcove, off a large [chamber] to the north. A [plain iron ladder] leads up through a [shaft].
You stand in a wide, tall, and dimly lit chamber. It has six sides; [smaller] alcoves open to the north and south.
You are lying across the tilted [face] of a wide [silver wheel], well [above] the floor. [Below] you, at the center of the [wheel], is a [large globe of violet glass]. A [ringed tan globe] is directly [above] you. Only your grip on one of the [rings] prevents you from sliding to the ground.
You are crouching on a [globe of blue glass] which is suspended at the center of the [great brass machine]. You cling to the [globe's] surface, which is patterned in [brown and white], as the inclined [brass disk] rotates dizzyingly around you. At the moment, the [copper wheel] is rotating upward around the [disk], as the [silver wheel] descends.
You are lying on a [globe of cratered green glass], which rotates inexorably around the edge of a wide [copper wheel]. You are rotating with it, which is not very pleasant. To one side, at the center of the [wheel], is a [red globe]. The floor is well [below] you.
[Above] you, at the center of the [wheel], is a [red globe]. The floor is far [below].
This is a [small], curved alcove, off a large [chamber] to the south. An [archway] to the north reveals a flight of ascending [stairs].
The [curving] corridor ends here, in a blank [plaster wall] relieved by a single [window]. The [window] looks out on a strange [subterranean] [prospect] to the west. You can return east, pass through the archway to the north, or take the stairs which descend to the south.
The [walls] here are [painted white] and are utterly undecorated. An archway leads south.
You are standing waist-deep in an [empty earthenware] [tub], in the midst of a trackless [jungle].
The [walls] of the room are [painted] in [green slashes], like the trunks of uncounted trees, and [splashed] with [gold].
Broad [golden] [pillars] march around the edge of this circular chamber. The [walls] between the [pillars] are deeply set, [painted] in variegated shades of [blue] and sea-green, and lit from some hidden [source]. An archway leads southwest, and there is a [door] to the east. The eastern [door] is closed; blinding [light] seeps out around its edges.
Your [torch], and the archway to the south, are the only sources of light; the passage vanishes into [cave-blackness], somewhere to the north.
A high, arched space opens around you, deep within the earth. The floor is unevenly interspersed with [stalagmites and stone columns]; your [torchlight] glitters in droplets from the [stalactites] [above]. Between the [pale], hanging [pinnacles] of frozen [stone], a [vein of dark ore] streaks the [vault].
You stand on the eastern [shore] of a [black river] -- a silent [sheet] of mirror-[dark water] which slips by as you watch. Somewhere, [far] to the south, you hear the thin roar of falling [water]. A broad passage leads back to the east.
You stand on the eastern [shore] of a [frozen river] -- an [irregular sheet of pale], cracked [ice]. It must not be solid to the bottom, for the current hisses and bubbles beneath the [ice], emerging beyond it.
You have reached the western side of the subterranean [river]. A narrow shelf of loose rubble slopes down to the [water's] [frozen] edge. The [ice] still spans the [river], although it is slowly wearing away in the silent current. The shore does not extend far up-[stream] or down; but at the top of the slope, a narrow crawl leads southwest, away from the [river]-passage.
The [ice] still spans the [river], although it is thin and beginning to crack.
You are crouched in a narrow twisting crawlway. A [faint rushing sound], distant [above] you, reveals that you are some way [below] the [dark river]. The crawl slopes upward to the northeast, back the way you came, and [angles] even more sharply downward to the southeast.
You are balanced on a [ledge], leaning against the [wall] of a twisty, irregular [pit]. Across from you, and slightly [above], you can see a [narrow opening] in the [wall]. A climbable [rough path] leads upward. You might be able to descend further, but the [pit] beneath you is nearly vertical, and the [stone] is damp and [slippery] with [condensation].
You might be able to descend further, but the [pit] beneath you is nearly vertical, and slick with [ice].
The [shaft] is roughly [vertical] here, and you cling to holds in the wall, hoping desperately that you do not slip. [Below] you, the [pit] narrows even further; the smooth [walls] gleam with [ice]. The climb [above] looks marginally safer.
You hang in a narrow [shaft], wedged knees-to-back between the [walls]. One hand clutches your [torch]; with the other, you cling to an [angle] in the [rock]. You are certain you cannot keep hold here for [long].
[Below] you, the [pit] narrows even further.
You might be able to descend further, although the [pit] beneath you is nearly vertical.
The passageway runs from southwest to northeast, more or less. Great [columns] and masses of [stone] rise from floor to [ceiling]; the tunnel divides and enjoins around them, a confusing wrangle of minor branches.
The passage from the southwest comes to an abrupt end here, in a [round], water-worn alcove. The [eastern wall] is of [dressed granite] -- an intrusion in these deep natural [caverns]. A [heavy iron door] is set into the [wall]; it is tightly shut.
You are at the edge of an immense and empty elliptical chamber. The [walls] are of [granite blocks], tightly fitted and [dressed, bare] of window or ornament. It feels like a vast cistern, not a place for human habitation. The only exit is the closed [door] directly west.
You are at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern, standing next to a [low glass platform]. The [platform] is about three strides across; it juts out from the [granite wall], a [bare] inch [above] the dead-[black] floor.
You are standing on a [low glass platform] at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern.
You are at the bottom of the cistern, at the edge, where the down-sloping floor meets the east [wall]. Directly [above] you hangs the [glass platform]; yards [above] that, the [catwalk] circumnavigates the room; and [above] that, the [white ellipse] of the [ceiling] spreads its [featureless] radiance.
You are standing on a [glass platform] at the eastern side of the elliptical cistern. The [platform] is about three strides across; it juts out over a deep well.
You stand on the [catwalk] -- or rather, in the [catwalk]. The [glass surface] is [curved], forming a shallow [trough]. It begins here, on the east side of the cistern, and follows the [wall] around to the north.
You stand in the [glass trough], on the northeast side of its arc. It runs northwest and southeast from here.
You stand in the [glass trough], on the north side of the chamber. It runs east and west from here. The [catwalk] is somewhat cracked at this [point]. The [cracks spiderweb] several feet of the [glass surface]; at their center, a [small hole] is broken right through.
You stand in the [glass trough], on the northwest side of the chamber. It runs southwest and northeast from here. The [catwalk] is rather cracked at this [point]. A [web of cracks] spreads nearly across the [trough]; at their center, a [large hole] is broken right through.
You stand in the [glass trough], at the west edge of the chamber. It runs south and north from here. The [catwalk] is heavily cracked at this [point]. The [cracks spiderweb] several feet of the [glass surface]; at their center, a [medium-sized] [hole] is broken right through.
You stand in the [glass trough], on the southwest side of its arc. It runs southeast and northwest from here.
You stand on the [black surface] which fills the [catwalk].
The [black catwalk] curves around from the southwest, but it bends sharply outward here -- straight into the southeast [wall], where it ends.
The [walls] of this [small room] are entirely swathed in [heavy brocade curtains]. The only [openings] are to the west and northwest, and a closed [lead-slab] [door] to the south.
This hall is a windowless square [tube of dark hammered iron], stretching south. [Yellow light] trembles in a [hanging sconce above] you.
You are in a [short] connecting passage, [walled] in [hammered iron]. A [heavy wooden door] stands to the north; to the south is a large chamber. A single [sconce] hangs [above] your head.
You stand in a chamber built of massive squared [stones]. The only exit is a plain doorway in the north wall. [Shelves] line the east side of the room; the opposite wall is [painted] with an [elaborate mural]. Between them, a [worktable] -- a single [heavy granite slab], cluttered with the tools of your work.
You are in a [small] round [dome], much [smaller] than the vast dark space [below].
You are standing on a [long, black] tongue of [shadow] which hangs impossibly in empty [air]. To the east stands the [fire-[lit]] [dome]; the [path] stretches away to the west. To the north side of the [path], the [mountain] towers, a [black] shape against the [starry] fields. On the other side, the [garden] slumbers in [green]; and [below] that, the [valley].
The [shadow path] narrows as it runs; a few yards farther west, it converges to a [point] and is gone. The [dome] is a red bauble to the east. To one side, the [mountain] towers, a [black] shape against the [stars]. On the other side falls the dim [green valley].
Firelight illuminates the [dome] from within. The [dome] rises from the [face] of a [moonlit] [mountain peak], which towers to the north. To the south, the stone [slopes] descend to a [dark valley].
This railless [catwalk] circles the outer edge of a pale [dome], which flickers with an inner [blue] fire.
To the east stands the [blue-lit dome]; the [path] stretches away to the west. To the north side of the [path], the [mountain] towers, a [black] shape against the [crimson currents] overhead. On the other side, the [garden] glows unearthly-pale; and [below] that, the [valley].
The curving surface is [translucent], [lit] with an eerie red glow.
The blank [plaster wall] to the south features a large [window]; a hellish red light pours in. You can go through the archway to the east, take the stairs which ascend to the west, or return north along the corridor.
This space, barely wider than your outstretched arms, seems to have been chopped raw from unfinished [stone]. Only the floor is [smooth] -- an [intricate web of geometric marks] which swirls from wall to wall. Eight [narrow gaps] pierce the [walls], one in [each] compass direction.
You are in a high, dim corridor, [walled] in [cracked and moldering white plaster]. The only light comes from [tiny flickering] [candles above]; [intricate geometric marks] cover the floor. The hall curves gently away in all eight directions.
Here, in the [forest] where you have spent your entire life, stands a huge Edifice, reaching into the clouds high above you.
Green sunlight filters in from the west through the [open recess], illuminating a small, round room, [simple] but totally foreign to you. A [staircase] (when did you learn that word?) winds up along the curved [wall] to another [level] above you, and, oddly, another [doorway] leads east, as if it would lead back into the [forest].
Well, this certainly isn't the Forest you've come to know and love. You are standing in the middle of a vast [grassland], broken only by the [incongruous] [stone arch] you passed through on your way here. Through it, you can see back into the dimly-lit Edifice to the west, a sharp contrast to the bright sunlight all around you.
The land here is divided by a stream, which has collected to form a [wide], still pool.
The lush grassland to the south and southwest begins to get [rocky] here. Just at the border between grassland and [rocks], a mighty [Tree] towers above you.
Climbing [trees] is a lot harder than you remember. You've managed to position yourself about [three-quarters] of the way up the [tree], and are sitting in a [fork] in the [trunk].
You are in the middle of an [open grassland], the only visible tree far to the north. Despite your history of living in a forest, the wide [open] space feels free and natural, as if you had spent your entire life here.
The main feature of this area of the grassland is a [large, squat, blackened Stump], evidently a [victim] of a past brush fire. The [grasses] wave around [Stump], and one or two have taken root in the [Stump] itself. Some day, this will be little more than a rise in the countryside.
The lush [grassland] to the west begins to peter out here, becoming more [rocky], [dry], and hilly.
Here you see the beginnings of a small [spring].
This room is akin to the room below. There are [staircases] going up and down, and another [door] going east.
This is a [small], cleared area in front of your [Hut] in the middle of the forest. The [autumn leaves] crunch under your feet, and the smell of winter is in the air. A well-worn [path] runs to the south towards the sound of rushing water, and another leads north, deeper into the forest.
You are inside the hut where it seems you have lived all your life. You live here with [Grandmother] (your [Mother]), [Wife, and Son]. The normally homey smell you associate with this place is currently masked by the smell of [sickness]. Stray light and fresh air come in [around] a hide-covered doorway, back to the west, but they do little to mask the sense of dread and concern that hangs over [everyone] in this room.
This is the [forest] where you hunt for food and skins, though you don't believe you'll be hunting much today. Some [birds] still chirp in the trees, though many have flown away, as they do [every] winter. The rustle of [wind] through the [golden leaves] counterpoints your own footsteps, as you wend your way through the [forest]. The [path] you used to get here goes back south, and another [path] leads northeast, which you've never used before today.
You've emerged from the northeast path to another [Hut], rather like your own. This one is larger, though, and has [woven leaves] as a [doorway] instead of a hide. This [Hut] is to the north, or you can go back down the path you came from the southwest.
Here, a [river wider] across than you can throw a stone [flows] past. You sometimes catch fish here, and your son loves to come here and skip rocks across the [river's] surface. Many [white-barked] [trees] grow close to the [river's] edge here, of a different variety than you usually see in the depths of the forest.
There is a [staircase] going down, and another [door] going east.
This is the [small Village] you seem to lead. It consists of several [small huts], plus a larger one with no [walls] the [People] use as a [meeting area]. The [People] are there now, in fact, arguing over something. The [ground] slopes down to the north, and a path leads along a ridge to the northwest. A [small stream] collects here, and follows the slope down to the north.
This path marks the beginnings of a descent down into the local canyon, to the northeast. To the west is a [small ragged cliff, small] enough here to scale, but which becomes a more imposing [wall] as you continue your descent into the canyon. A [small stream], beginning to show life again after the worst of the summer heat, follows its rocky [bed] here, as it continues down into the canyon.
This path meanders northeast along the edge of a [small cliff] to the east, as it wends its way amongst the scrub. Your Village is back to the southeast.
You are at the base of a box [canyon]. [Ragged [walls]] [tower] over you on three sides, [striated red, black, and tan]. The [small stream] running along here dries up in the summer, but is now still active. A [crack] in the north [wall] of the [canyon] allows it to pass along its path from the Village, back up to the southwest.
The [stream] from the south cuts through the [wall] of the canyon here, and runs for several paces before cascading down a [steep, gravelly slope]. The sides of the canyon provide a welcome shade from the hot sun, which apparently is also enjoyed by a [small grove of Fruit Trees, clustered] around a wide section of the [stream].
The view is almost a blur around you, as [Horse] runs frantically, trying to get you off his back. Every so often, you notice some feature of the [landscape], but, unsurprisingly, most of your attention is on [Horse], and your bumpy ride.
Right now, the entire place is rather deserted, as [everyone] is down in the Canyon, trying to learn how to ride a Horse like you did. The [ground] slopes down to the northeast, and a path leads along a ridge to the northwest. A [small stream] collects here, and follows the slope down to the northeast.
You are on a [path] in a dense, dark [forest]. You have come from the west; the [path] continues east.
The [path] bends northward. The light seems brighter up ahead.
In the clearing before you stands a tremendous [tower]. It rises high above you, higher than you can see.
You see no entrance on this side either. You could proceed north or south around the [tower].
You could proceed east or west around the [tower].
This large round chamber fills the entire first level of the tower. The vaulted ceiling is about fifty feet above you. There are no windows, but light comes from white [lamps] mounted in the walls. Polished stone [stairs] curve around the tower wall from the north up to the west.
You are in a wide corridor on the west side of the tower. It curves around to the north and south. Polished stone [stairs] descend.
This large circular room occupies the center of the tower. Arched doorways lead north and south, and an [iron ladder] climbs through a hole in the ceiling.
This [square] room has exits in all four directions. An [iron ladder] descends through a [hole] in the floor.
A [pedestal] stands in the middle of this small chamber.
A [pedestal] stands in the middle of this room.
A [spiral staircase] climbs to the next level.
This 50-foot-high chamber extends to the outer wall. Daylight enters from the east through a large arched doorway. A smaller door leads north, and stone [steps] curve up along the tower wall.
The stairs end at a small landing. There is a closed [door] to the north.
There is an open [door] to the north.
A [thick maroon carpet] runs the length of this hall, about 40 feet northward. A doorway leads south.
The hall ends here. A tight [spiral staircase] climbs upward. Closed [doors] lead north, east, and west.
This appears to be a small [bedroom] furnished with a [bed], a [nightstand], and a [writing desk]. It seems a little out of place in this austere tower. An open [door] leads south, and a small [doorway] leads west.
There is a closed [door] to the south, and a small [doorway] leads west.
This small closet is empty, except for a [panel] on the wall.
This small closet is empty, except for a [panel] on the wall, behind which is a [lever].
You are at the end of a tight corridor that leads north. A [spiral staircase] descends.
You are at an intersection of corridors. You could go west, east, or south. Three [arrows] are painted on the floor: a [black] arrow points west, a [white] arrow points east, and a [red] arrow points south.
You could go north, east, or south. Three [arrows] are painted on the floor: a [red] arrow points north, a [white] arrow points east, and a [black] arrow points south.
You could go north, east, or west. Three [arrows] are painted on the floor: a [white] arrow points west, a [red] arrow points north, and a [black] arrow points east.
Three [arrows] are painted on the floor: a [white] arrow points north, a [red] arrow points west, and a [black] arrow points east.
You have reached the end of a corridor. You can return to the south. An iron [ladder] climbs through a hole in the ceiling.
The southeastern wall of this large room curves with the tower. The room is decorated with a number of [paintings].
This room seems to be at the center of the tower. Doorways go east and west. A [spiral staircase] goes up.
The northwestern wall of this room curves with the tower. In the middle of the room you see a [table] with a [box] on top.
You are at the end of a corridor. Your only option is to return west. An open [marble hand] extends from the east wall.
This is a square room with [gates] in all four directions. A [spiral staircase] winds upward and downward.
This room has a wooden floor of alternating dark and light squares. [Doorways] lead north, east and south. The way west is blocked by an [iron door].
An open [door] leads west.
This small room is empty except for a [round platform] in the center. You notice a [round] hole in the ceiling above the [platform]. You can exit to the east.
This semicircular room fills the eastern half of the tower. Along the outer wall, one [stairway] curves down to the south, and a narrower one curves up to the north. At the landing between them, a large [grating] is set in the floor.
This small round room has no doors. The [spiral staircase] continues up and down.
This room occupies the northeast quadrant of the tower. A doorway leads south, and a wooden ramp descends. A [ladder] on the outer wall climbs to the next level.
This room takes up the northeast quarter, just like the level below. Doorways lead west and south, and a [ladder] descends.
The southeast quarter of the level is empty except for a large [plaque] on the wall. A doorway leads north, and a [spiral staircase] ascends.
A massive, chugging [machine] fills most of the southern half of this level. You can leave through a door to the north, or go down a [spiral staircase].
This room is empty, except for an [iron door] in the north wall. Five small [lights] are mounted in the [door]. You can exit to the south.
This square chamber, about 30 feet across, is dominated by a large [waterwheel] mounted on the west [wall]. A [doorway] leads east.
This level is filled with a strange [apparatus]. All around you is a network of scaffolding with little wooden water [channels, wheels, rockers, funnels, and basins], all swishing and clacking as water runs through them.
This is the bottom of a twenty-foot-deep pool. There is a large [drain] in the floor. [Iron rungs] climb the wall. A low passageway leads south.
This looks like the bottom of a another [square] pool, almost identical to the first. [Rungs] climb upward and a passageway leads north.
This room occupies part of the southwest quarter. [Rungs] lead down into a [square hole].
The northern exit of this chamber is blocked by a [portcullis]. But it doesn't matter, because there is also a small [secret door].
Through an open [door] in the north wall, [stairs] lead up.
You are wedged comfortably into your [lair], relaxing in the cold comfort of a stone crevice, the [walls] worn smooth by years of occupation. Here, the darkness is complete, like Mother's comforting, opaque [fur]. No luminous fungi or glowing worms venture here with their harsh, painful light.
You sense a tasty [adventurer] in the [cavern].
You sense a tasty [adventurer] in the [tunnel].
You sense a tasty [adventurer] in the [grotto].
You sense a tasty [adventurer] in the [hollow].
It is [pitch] dark, and you can't see a thing. Also your [eyes] are closed. Which is fine. The [adventurer] whispers into the darkness and fumbles with something, "Please light. Please light." There is another wooden scratching sound.
You sense a tasty [adventurer] in the [pit].
What other people like to call lazy, you like to consider meditative; it shows in how sparsely decorated your [room] is. The walls are bare, [outside] of a shoddy [closet] built into one of them. Your garage-sale [nightstand] sits next to your equally impressive [bed], bringing the entire motif of the [room] somewhere into the realm of "bachelor-crap-hole." To the south is your [living room], and west is the entrance to your [bathroom].
It isn't in the best shape, but it isn't condemned either (mostly because as far as the city is concerned, this [room] doesn't even exist). It has the normal [bathroom] fixtures; a [shower], a [counter] with a [sink and mirror, and toilet]. To the east is your [bedroom].
The walls are bare, [outside] of a shoddy [closet] built into one of them, which is open and displaying your [pile of ratty old shoes] and your [work clothes].

So... this is where you live. Usually, you only leave if you absolutely have to, for example to get fresh supplies of chemicals. The [apartment] consists only of one single room which serves as living room, [bedroom], kitchen and even bathroom combined. The downside is that you couldn't get a place without a [window], so you're not safe from the effects of the [sun] in here. The regular exit is a [door] on the north wall.
Statistically, this is the place you've entered and left most in your life ([outside] of your [apartment]): Once on your way to work and once on your way home. The street leads west to the university (where you work) and east to the city centre. At least you've been told the latter when you moved here - you never tested this hypothesis. The [sun's] rays, reflected from one of the city's shiny [mail tubes], sting in your eyes like needles.
Due to the [sun's] glaring brightness, you have to squint your eyes in order to see anything at all. The campus consists of a number of [grey buildings] from the 1970s. You can see the [building] you used to work in to the west. A path leading around it to the southwest. The only bearable sight is the elegant [mail tube] emerging from the [building] walls. Some [students] are here, joking amongst themselves and laughing. Without a doubt, the target of their laughter is you!
All these buildings look alike - you recognise the familiar hospital atmosphere. An [office door] welcomes you to the west. The windowless corridor leads north towards your old workplace (as well as your boss's [office]) and stairs allow going upstairs (where the more privileged members of the department work). The building's exit is located to your east.
This is supposed to be an [office]? It's so clean and tidy you're wondering how anyone could possibly get any work done here!
Since all these corridors look alike, you have put a [mark] on this part of the [wall] to recognise the [door] leading to your [lab] - which can be found in the north [wall]. To your west, you think can see the [portal] to hell: the [door] of your [boss's] office. The [ceiling light] is flickering a bit... annoying you to no end.
So this is where what most [people] call "life" is. In the general chaos of [people] walking around [everywhere], you can make [out] a [locksmith's] [shop] to the south, a [pub] (whose wall is sporting a [ventilation] [opening]) to the east and a [hospital] to the north. In the light of the ant-like chaotic movement of the [people], the only thing giving you a little calm is the regulated flow of the [mail tubes] leading to [every] building. The air seems to be standing completely still here, making the grinding heat caused by the [sun] even worse than normal. Oh, how you hate the [sun]!
One word is enough to describe this place: smoke. Smoke is what you see, smoke is what you smell and if smoke had a sound, you're sure you'd hear it, too. Tired [customers] are hunched over the [tables] and a [door], presumably leading to the [kitchen], can be seen in the north wall ([behind] the [bar]).
You sometimes heard your colleagues talking about media reports about unhygienic restaurant [kitchens]. You can't see any evidence of that here. It's just as clean as your own home!
The [hospital] is a depressing place. Lots of ill or dead people being pushed around in [beds]. [Signs] point the ways to the maternity ward (west), the emergency room (east) and the luxurious single rooms for the not-really-very-ill (north). The buildings exit is to the south.
The corridor ends in a dead end here, so the only way it can be followed is to the south. [Two] more rooms are located east and west.
The upstairs [corridor] leads north to the [department] [door]. Stairs are leading down.
In this [office], the (relatively speaking) privileged engineers usually work, but they don't seem to be here right now. A door is embedded into the east wall, a [window] in the west wall. Next to the door, there is an array of [coat hooks].
Quite a bare bone room, but at least the engineers on this floor have a break room at all. In the corner, you can see a [water cooler].
You sit at the far end of the long dining table in a kind of [dock], carefully fenced in with a quadrilateral of light bedroom [chairs], any of which you could toss [out] the window with your big toe. You have been provided with [pens and paper]. So far you have made [paper boats], [paper darts, and paper dolls] contentedly throughout the whole proceedings. You are as unconscious as a child on the floor of an empty nursery, and are in fact so absorbed that you don't seem to see or hear the rest of the room.
The [sea] itself looks like absinthe, [green] and bitter and poisonous. In the [sky] is that early and stormy darkness that is so depressing to the mind, and the wind blows shrilly round a little lonely coloured kiosk where they sell newspapers, and along the hills of sand by the [shore].
A small French [cafe] sits quiet by the waves. West lies the sea. It is late afternoon, and the [tables and chairs] are all empty.
You stand on a lonely [train platform] under a cold, [greenish] evening [sky]. A little snow has fallen, but not enough to whiten the plain, which stretches away in a sort of sad purple in all directions, save where the flat tops of some distant tablelands catch the evening light like lakes.
Farther north, you see a knot of rowdies, the embers of a recent [train] strike. They don't look friendly.
You stand on the far end of the [platform], alone in this desolation with the [stationmaster].
You stand in someone's kitchen [garden] beside someone's kitchen [wall]. In the dead of night and the haze, the [wall] is eerie in the shadows of the [trees], but it looks just wide enough to walk on.
You climb the [ladder] and walk along the narrow [wall]. [Percy and Hawkins] follow, but within [five] steps, [Hawkins] realizes where he is and stops.
The [garden wall] is narrow, but an excellent [right-of]-way that intersects with the [walls] that divide the [gardens] of the rowhouses. This main [wall] runs east and west, and the even narrower dividing [wall] runs north.
This narrow [wall] runs north and south between the [two] gardens of [two] unsuspecting rowhouses.
You stand an a broad road of flat [roofs], broader than many a thoroughfare, with [chimney-pots] here and there that seem in the haze as bulky as small forts.
The floor is bare in this [attic], whomever it may belong to, and the [darkness] is intense.
The pleasant little shop is neat and tidy, [dresses, fabrics], [threads], and all the other accoutrements of the trade properly in their place.
You stand on a narrow city street, before the frowning offices of Trip, Publishers. A [stern door] guards the entrance to the north.
The grim and grimy [lobby of Trip, Publishers], hangs heavy with its burden of ink. South lies the exit and freedom, north lies a murky corridor, and a staircase leads up to the first floor.
You stand on the [stage] of a packed [auditorium].
You stand in a starry night of bewildering brilliancy; [stars] burn [both] in the [skies above] and the [puddles] [below]. In the great black bulk of the [college], the only [light] (other than [stars]) glows through one [peacock-green curtain] in the upper part of the building. A side door lies north.
(You are now in the [driveway].) (You're sitting in the sports [car].) You are by the front [gate of Tresyllian] [Castle]. You can hear the [ocean] beating urgently against the rocks far below. In the [moonlit] gloom, you can make out an [ornament] on the [gate]. It's a [winged], two-legged [dragon] called a [wyvern], which crests the [Tresyllian] family's coat of arms. The [dragon] appears in profile. The [moonlight] glints on its [lone] visible [eye].
(You are in the [courtyard].) It looks even [lovelier] than it sounds in the tourist brochure. The dark [stone turrets] rise toward the [misty] [sky]. [Tamara] is listening to you. Your new little green sports [car] is parked here.
[Tamara] is looking at you hopefully.
(You are in the [foyer].)
[Lord Jack] is surveying his domain.
[Lord Jack] is listening to you.
(You are in the drawing [room].)
[Vivien and Hyde] are sipping sherry.
[Vivien] is sipping sherry. [Hyde] is listening to you.
[Vivien and Hyde] are listening to you.
(You are in the new great [hall].)
The [hall] is floored with black and white marble tiles. They've been worn smooth by footsteps over the centuries, especially near the archway to the drawing [room].
[Ian] is looking debonair. [Iris] is listening to you.
[Iris] is looking coy. Dr. [Wendish] is waiting patiently. Dr. [Wendish] repeats, "I said: Is it a case that brings you to Cornwall?"
Dr. [Wendish] is looking muddled.
(You are in the [gallery].) The [gallery] spans the top of the double [stairways]. You can go east to your [bedroom] or west to [Vivien's] [bedroom]. [Hallways] lead to the northeast and northwest. On the [wall] is a [series] of oil [paintings of Lord Jack's] ancestors.
(You are in your [bedroom].) Your [room] is decorated in shades of green. You see your [bathroom] to the north and a cozy [fireplace] in one corner. The [room] is furnished with a [bed], a night [table] with a [lamp] on it, a [chest of drawers], a [wardrobe], a [wing chair], and a dressing [table] with [mirror and bench]. There's also a full-[length] [wall mirror]. On your [bed] you see your [luggage]. [Bolitho] is waiting patiently.
[Bolitho] is listening to you.
[Bolitho] is awaiting orders.
[Bolitho] repeats, "I said: May I offer one last suggestion?"
On the [wing chair] you see the dinner [outfit] and the aerosol [device].
(You are in your [bathroom].) From the look of it, your [bathroom] was added in recently. It is comfortable and inviting, especially for Cornwall.
[Tamara] is waiting patiently. [Lord Jack and Ian and Iris] are lounging and chatting.
(You are in the [kitchen].) The [kitchen] is large yet cramped. From here, you can go west to the [tower basement], east to the servants' quarters, or up the [stairs]. [Bolitho] is preparing [dinner]. An appetizing aroma wafts from an array of covered [dishes] sitting about.
(You are in the [library].) Dusty [bookcases] [tower] all around you. There is a [table] with reading [lamp and chair], and an [armchair] near the [fireplace].
(You are in the dining [room].) This [room] is impeccably furnished, but it's too formal for relaxing. [Lord Jack] and all his [guests] are here. They smile pleasantly but, with typical British reserve, seem willing to leave you to your own [devices]. A brooding [bust of Lionel Tresyllian] ([sculpted] by [Vivien]) is displayed in a corner.
(You're sitting on a [chair].)
You are standing at a dead-end. The only way [out] is back east.
You are standing next to Mortlake Manor. The front [door] is to the south, a paved path to the west and the east follows the [outside] of the house. The drive is to the north.
You are standing on a north-south path with some [french windows] to the west, and a fountain in the middle of a hedgemaze to the east. There is a balcony above you, which must have an excellent view of the garden.
You are standing in front of a [door] to the north. There is a garden to the south, and a paved path leading to the west and the east.
You are standing with the [back door] to the south. A passage way continues to the north.
You are standing in a stylish bedroom. There is a door to the east, and another to the south. There are heavy [curtains] on the windows, and they are closed.
There are heavy [curtains] on the windows, and they are open.
You are standing on the roof of the manor, next to a [metallic flagpole] that sounds as if it is hollow. A spiral staircase winds down into the attic.
You are standing on the roof of the manor. There is a broken [flagpole] on the ground.
You are standing at the intersection of a north-south corridor and an east-west passage. There is a large suit of [armour] here.
You are standing at the north end of the library. There are doorways to the east and west. Piles of [books] and manuscripts litter the floor.
You are standing at the south end of the library. There is an enormous [bookcase] along the southern wall.
You are standing in the smoking room. Piles of ash litter the floor. There is an enormous [bookcase] along the northern wall.
There is what was once a beautiful [chandelier] smashed to thousands of tiny pieces on the floor.
You are standing in a walk-in wardrobe. The only way [out] is to the north.
You are standing in a north-south corridor. There is a [picture] on the wall here.
You are standing in the boiler room. There are a lot of rusty [pipes] here, and a [switch] on the wall labelled "[fountain]". The only exit is west.
You are standing next to a [working fountain].
You've had this place redecorated a few times. [Eleanor] has been good enough to keep the paints downstairs, which has prevented any inadvertant graffiti. Although she sometimes threatens to paint in [bed] when you've been annoying her, and that sends shivers down your spine. At present, the [ceiling] is awash with silver stars against a [blue] sky, while the [bed and dresser] are coloured purple and gold for contrast. The [carpet] is a pleasant [green]. Since the last change [Eleanor] keeps complaining about headaches in a pointed fashion, and you're on the point of caving and having it changed to something more pedestrian. But it'd be a shame, you spent days working it all [out].
This is a room to pass through. Thus, you've made sure to fill it with things that you need to remember, in the hope that they'll catch your eye at the right time. At the moment, you have a pair of [frames] hanging on the wall, one containing a [diagram], and the other some [pressed leaves].
Eleanor's [works] are arrayed here. She spent some time making sure they were all hanging at the same level, and the effect is striking. You haven't been able to do the same for the landing.
You've taken to avoiding this room recently. Your [desk] has started to seem menacing. Aside from that, you've got a [chair], and a [shelf] which you use to keep [work]-related items.
Dwarven [tents] are short and stout. They're also fairly resilient.
You're lost. The path has faded away, and there's an awful lack of points of reference. You notice [birds] flying above you, and feel envious.
Without the plants, the field looks desolate. The only other feature is a [rugged]-looking [tree], with an enormous pile of [weird pods] lying at its feet.
You can't see anything new about the situation, although the brightness of the [sun] becomes more noticable.
You stand amidst the [remains] of the [plants], and feel a strange vibration through your feet.
You imagined that you could display your own work here, but that hasn't quite worked [out]. As is, there's a [collection] of your [inspirations], to which you frequently return.
[Stairs] above you lead back to the surface. [Stairs] below you lead nowhere, having collapsed into a [pit]. Around you, is a small cave.
This is a wide area, filled with [goblins], all hard at work with their [mining]. You're glad your gear includes a helmet.
While there aren't actually any goblins sleeping here right now, you can recognise the function of the place from the [crude beds] scattered around.
Whatever you've heard about goblins, this room is very neatly organised. [Everything] is locked in labelled boxes. Except for a single [ladder], which is presumably because of its great height.
The chamber is filled with [shrieking goblins], waving their hands in the air aimlessly. You can just about hear some drumming from the north end, and just about see a goblin wearing brightly coloured clothes.
Up here, you've got a much better view. You can see a [goblin] dressed in what looks like a monk's robe, but made from a dazzling yellow cloth. He is beating a pair of drums.
Here, you stand in a small circle surrounding the [goblin drummer], surrounded itself by an impassable throng of [goblins]. Neither the [drummer] nor his audience are paying you any attention.
About you are four passageways. You sense the majesty of the king to the north, the smallness of the servants to the west, and the [outer] sanctum to the east.
Here, the [servants] have been placed. [Each] of them has a task to perform for the king in the underworld. You remember their joy as they were chosen.
The [mystic] light is weaker here, and there are many [shadows]. You wonder what went wrong during the rituals.
An entry room. Now that the thieves have fled, the only thing remaining is a strange [machine] that they brought with them. Sadly, they've made off with some minor treasures, but at least the peace has been restored.
With some difficulty, you managed to acquire a [table] that was precisely the correct size. Eleanor and you can quite comfortably talk across it between mouthfuls. You've filled the walls with [portraits] of various dignitaries in preparation for receiving guests. Under which circumstances you'll have to bring up the other [table] currently residing in the cellar.
This rock has a [lightning rod] set into to it. As you might expect, the [rod] has a [halo] of electricity continously washing around it. Fortunately, ielectricity isn't too dangerous to you, you can touch it safely.
A [rainbow] ends here, coming in from the west.
Differently coloured [clouds] float around you. This place seems to be some type of attractor for them.
There's still some of the electric [halo] hanging around hopefully, but the majority of it has vanished .
Your rock is a simple one, without luxury. Your [stuff] lies around you.
That's unusual. There's an [airship crashed] here. There must have been some especially thick [cloud] cover recently. And you suppose that this particular rock is pretty large.
There are still a few [bits and pieces] lying around.
Here, there is a [dragon]. A [silver] one. You feel unnerved by its presence. And what's it doing here? And he's got a [hoard of treasure].
The daemons keep this room nice and clean. You have to pay them for the service of course, but it's definitely worth it. As you might expect, there's a [toilet], a [sink] and a [bath]. You considered getting a shower, but that seems a bit too modern for the general theme you've established. Oh yes, there's also a [mechanical] [musician] in the corner.
The [culprit] of the crimes is [trapped] in front of you, in the [sphere] that Eleanor painted. He glares at you, but you sense that he is powerless to do anything.
[Cabin], on the [bed] You are in an officer's [cabin], lit by the firelight glowing through a [porthole]. A [door] is to starboard. Except for the built-in [bed], the [room] seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly. "The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!" yells someone.
Suddenly, the [ship] lurches to one side, throwing you out of the [bed]. A [coffer] slides from under the [bed] and bumps against your foot.
[Cabin] You are in an officer's [cabin], lit by the firelight glowing through a [porthole].
You can see a [coffer] here. "Cap'n [Jamison]! We've got 'em!" cries a rough voice.
[Crulley] the [pirate, hook] raised, leering, comes toward you.
"Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty," sniggers the [pirate]. His breath is heavy with rum. "Aaieeee!" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.
"They calls me Andy, but I'm really randy," sniggers the [pirate], advancing toward you. [Crulley] drags you, despite your resistance, towards [him]. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, [Crulley] collapses at your feet, his [eyes] rolling. A tall form blocks the shattered [door], one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand -- he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea-blue [eyes].
The [pirate captain] is studying you. He has a [rapier]. [Crulley] the [pirate] lies unconscious on the floor.
To your surprise, the stranger bows. "Well met, my lady." His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. "I am [Captain] Nicholas [Jamison], known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your [father] has sent me." He chuckles at your glare of distrust. "Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried -- I carry this." He [hands] you a missive.
The [pirate captain] glances around the empty [room], then notices the [coffer]. "[Davis's] safety [box] -- my [men] were hoping I'd find it." He takes it and nudges the unconscious [man] on the floor, "I wonder how [Crulley] knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes." The [pirate] bows. "My lady, may I offer my protection and my [ship] until your [father] is free?"
He has a [coffer] and a [rapier].
"We haven't time to waste. Will you come willingly or not?" says [Captain] [Jamison].
[Deck] The [deck] is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring [fires], silhouetted forms crash [swords], dancing around the screaming wounded.
[Captain's] [Quarters], on the [bed] The [room] has a masculine [air], with ebony panelling, a large messy [table], and a rumpled [bed] (upon which you lie).
"I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. [Crulley] isn't the only [man] aboard with few principles." He smiles at you, [eyes] lingering, and takes your [hand]. You feel your color rising. "If anything goes wrong, turn to [Cookie]. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through."
His look darkens. "You should know why I hate [Lafond]: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, [pirates] struck. Their [ship] was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A [sailor], the one survivor, watched as a [man of Lafond's] description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. [Lafond] has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace." [Jamison] straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.
Captain's [Quarters] The [room] has a masculine [air], with ebony panelling, a large messy [table], and a rumpled [bed].
It seems that the [coffer] contains an [invitation].
[Men] clomp about overhead and a [rope ladder] unfurls itself past the [window]. [Jamison] climbs down it, entering the skiff that awaits [him] below. He rows to the [island] as the [men] above your [head] disperse, calling farewells to their captain.
Landing You are on the landing of a steep [stairway] [heading] up and down.
Aft Hold This is a gloomy, damp [area] at the bottom of the Helena [Louise].
Hold Steep [stairs] lead up in the dimness to a canvas [hatch] above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the [deck] overhead. You may move fore or aft.
Crew's Quarters The crew [sleeps], in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a [moonbeam] through a [grate] in the [ceiling]. A low doorsill is abaft.
It seems that the large [cupboard] contains a pile of [clothes].
Sleeping [Cupboard] The [bed] is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of [Jamison]. The [cupboard] opens to the fore.
The end of a [rope ladder] blows past the [window].
Captain's [Quarters], on the [ledge] The [room] has a masculine [air], with ebony panelling, a large messy [table], and a rumpled [bed].
The end of a [rope ladder] blows by.
On the [Ladder] You are clinging to a slimy [ladder], tied to a rail of the poop [deck] above you.
The [reefs] are definitely getting larger.
Rebounding, the [ladder] twists you around to face the Helena [Louise].
The [ladder] swings back towards the Helena [Louise].
Poop From this platform [deck] you can see the whole of the two-masted [ship], shadowy forms moving about here and there. A [railing] protects you from stepping off the [deck] in any [direction] but to the fore. A [rope ladder] is tied to the [railing] at the stern of the [ship].
Quarterdeck No torches are lit, or needed on this [moonlit] night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation [wheel].
Main [Deck] It is a deceptively quiet evening on the [ship], the [pirates] singing low shanties as they repair [cannon], twist [ropes] and sharpen [daggers].
Forecastle Higher than all but the poop [deck], this end of the [ship] commands a good view of the [island]; the "crow's nest," swinging above in the heights of the [foremast], would command a better.
The [mainmast] casts an inky shadow over the open [hatch and stairs] leading down to the [hold].
Hold [Moonlight] shines down the [stairs] through an open corner of the canvas [hatch] above.
Quarterdeck, in the [cask] No [torches] are lit, or needed on this [moonlit] night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation [wheel].
[Lagoon], in the [cask] You are crouched in a [cask] on the [lagoon] of St. [Sinistra]. The jungle looms gray-green in the [light] of the full moon. The current pulls you in towards the [island].
Music floats down to the [water], mingling with the distant roar of the sea.
With a scrape, the [cask] lodges in the sand.
[Shallows], in the [cask] You are crouched in the [cask] in the warm, lapping waves of the [shallows]. A white sand [beach] is west of you.
[Shallows] You are soaking your [shoes] and stockings in the warm, lapping waves of the [shallows].
[Beach] This is a tiny [beach], at the base of [vine]-covered [cliffs]. To the east, the Helena [Louise] floats serenely on the [lagoon].
Lawn Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a [folly] entangled in blooming [jasmine]. The way to the [beach] is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the [folly] a thorny [hedge] blocks the [cliff] view of the sea.
[Folly] Perfumed by the [heady] odor of the night-blooming [jasmine] entwined in the bamboo latticework, this [folly] is a cool, dark haven. One bamboo [slat] at the back seems to be loose. A [bench] is built into the [wall], circling the [folly]. Captain [Jamison] enters the [folly], stooping to avoid the [flowers] dangling over the door. "I thought I heard someone. What the devil are you doing here!
[Jamison] sighs. "What an astonishing girl you are, my dear. And so ingeniously [dressed]." He plucks a [flower] from the tangle above the door, and sets it in your hair. "The beauty of this blossom is nothing to yours."
You can see a [hole] here. Catching his breath, [Jamison] pulls you against [him], his [hands] circling your waist, crushing the [flower] between you. "Darling," he whispers, leaning over you, "oh, my angel ..."
"My lovely," [Jamison] says huskily. His [eyes] burn intently, their blue like the sea on a summer day. A shiver of warmth flows through you, and you tremble at his touch. The [pirate's] [hands], warm and exciting, caress you, searing through the thin linen of your [chemise]. His [lips] near yours, his breath softly scented. "May I kiss you?"
Tender is his kiss, soft his [lips] as his body presses hard against you. You drown in the tide of your passion, swept like the sea against the rocks of the shore.
With a pent-up sigh, Nicholas forces [himself] away from you. "Now is not the time or the [place] to advance my suit," he says, wistfully. "But the night is still young and you are so beautiful! I must be gone, lest I lose my soul in you." With an engaging smile he bows and leaves the [folly].
In the [Hedge] You crouch in the green rustlings of the [hedge]. Not far east, wind keens up the [cliff], high above swells breaking against a rocky shore. You know the [folly] is somewhere to the west. North, the [hedge] is somewhat less dense.
By the [House] You crouch in the [hedge] by the [house], twigs poking into you, the [cliff] crumbling away to the east. The [hedge] seems less dense to the south. A closed [window] is [directly] west of you.
An open [window] is [directly] west of you.
Library Everything in this private office is larger than life. A huge [portrait] decorates the north side, and black [drapes] mask the east [wall]. [Bookshelves] tower over a cherry [desk], and a massive [wooden] [globe] squats in a corner. Music wafts distantly from the [ballroom] across the hall to the south.
A [knob] juts out of the [wall].
Main Entrance The front door stands open to the south, [light] splayed out onto a drive stretching north into the jungle. A path leads around the western wing of the [house]; jutting out from the east wing is a tall [hedge].
Trade Entrance You are on a well-trampled lawn at the side of the [house], one low doorway leading in to the east.
Kitchen A [firepit] in the floor smokes badly, fogging up the depths of this large kitchen, somehow not escaping through either the south or west doors.
A [firepit] in the floor smokes badly, fogging up the depths of this large kitchen, somehow not escaping through either the south or west doors. [Lucy] huddles alone by the fire, as if cold. She has a [garter].
Clearing You are in a small clearing under the western side of the [house].
[Bedroom] Lit only with [moonlight] through the open [window], tonight this [room] is serving as a ladies' [dressing] [room]. An exit lies to the north.
Lit only with [moonlight] through the open [window], tonight this [room] is serving as a ladies' [dressing] [room].
Upstairs Hall You stand in a carpeted hallway, leading east to a [stair] landing.
Parlour This [room] is exotically furnished with a Turkey [divan] and chairs.

Upstairs Hall You stand in a carpeted hallway, leading west to a [stair] landing.
Foyer A grandiose staircase splits and twists up to the next floor here, framing the entrance south to the ballroom. Long hallways lead east and west; cool night [air] drifts in through the front door, north of you.
Ballroom [Lafond's] party is well attended: you can hardly move for the crush. However, the [room] is oddly silent, no talk interrupting the musical efforts of the musicians to the west. Despite the heat, no one ventures south to the veranda, nor through the opening east. The foyer is north of you.
"I haven't found your [father]. We've long suspected a passage under the [library], but I cannot find an entrance," says [Jamison].
"If there is any trouble, and I am unable to help -- a signal from an upstairs seaward window will bring my [men]. They can be here in moments," the [Captain] says. Your [hands] linked tightly with his and held high over your [heads], a line of dancers files between you and [Jamison].
His [eyes] twinkle, like [moonlight] on the sea. Together you whirl around the ballroom, his arm snug around your waist, leading you gracefully, masterfully. Nicholas's grip tenses as he nods to a bewigged [man] staring at you. You turn, and the [man] moves on.
[Jamison] grins down at you, a dazzling white smile. The music ends with a flourish and you pirouette once more before curtseying to [Jamison]. As you move to the side of the dance floor, Nick adds, "We should separate -- I'm sure I am being watched. You would be safer aboard the Helena [Louise]. If you [slip] out the veranda [doors], no one will notice you leaving." He touches your [hand] and dissolves into the crowd.
[Orchestra] A few older women and young girls sit near the small [orchestra] assembled at this end of the ballroom.
A few older women and young girls sit near the small [orchestra] assembled at this end of the ballroom.
The [man's] smile hardens. "You have your [father's] [eyes]. I am [Lafond] --  I have recently become intimate with that gentleman." He slightly stresses the word "intimate." "Now, tell me 'yes.' And remember, I am a [man] of my word."
"So you know I am not your [father's] friend," [Lafond] says, offering a [hand] for the promenade. "Unfortunately, you are in my power, he is in my dungeon and I am still King of these waters." A gold [ring] flashes on his [hand]. It seems vaguely familiar.
[Lafond's] [eyes] rake your body. "When I am ready, the butler will summon you to sup with me in my [room]; it may be some time. We will find much in common before dawn, I am sure. Then I may free your [father]." [Lafond] bows as the dance ends, and kisses your [hand]. He cocks his [head], curious, "You have far less spirit than your [father] credited you. He swore you would have [him] freed in no time at all. A pity, I prefer doyennes with mettle." He moves to speak with the butler, then drifts into the crowd.
[Veranda] [Steps] lead south from this white marble [veranda] to a clipped lawn. To the north a line of people blocks your view of the ballroom.
Supper [Room] One long [table] set across the north entrance indicates that supper was served here earlier.
A huge [portrait], slightly awry from the [wall], decorates the north side, and black [drapes] mask the east [wall].
[Stairwell] Cool salt [air], blowing past a [torch] on a spiral [staircase] below you, ruffles your hair and circles south into the [library].
Bottom of [Stairwell] Flickering [torchlight] [lights] the bottom of a spiral staircase.
North Passage A strong wet breeze blows from a low doorway to the east. A circle of [light] leads west. The passageway continues south.
Guard's Bunkroom Once a [cell], now, with the door missing, made into a guard's bunkroom, this [room] is distinctly uncomfortable. Gasps of [air] are forced through a [crack] in the seaward [wall] of the [room]. The way out is west of you.
South Passage You are at the far end of a dank passageway [heading] north. A wooden [door] leads east.
[Cell] This tiny [cell] is [airless] and shivering cold, entirely empty of anything but darkness. A wooden [door] leads west.
Anteroom Two exits lead from this cavernous [room], north and south. The [walls] drip with wet, forming a huge [pool] on the floor.
The [crocodile] lies half in the [pool], gazing at you, [mouth] closed. With an inaudible creak, the [crocodile's] [mouth] opens again.
Without warning, the [crocodile] relaxes, [eyes] closed, asleep.
The [crocodile] lies half in the [pool, sleeping].
Dungeon You sense, rather than see, the rusty skeletons of old cages and torture devices that line the [walls] of this cavernous [room]. One flaming [torch], high on a wall, casts mad licks of [light] into the darkness. Passages lead north and west. Set deep in the rocky floor is a closed [trapdoor].
Corner This short passage turns from east to north to stop abruptly at an iron [door].
[Cell] Hewn from dense rock, the [cell] is a stagnant burrow. Except for the tiniest glow of [light] from the torch two [rooms] away, it is pitch black.
There is a commotion from the west. A [woman] screams and a [man] yells, "Stop, [Pirate]!" You run to the foyer in time to see two [dragoons] dragging out the battered [frame of Captain] [Jamison]. An officer quiets the guests, "This is the buccaneer who has been pirating our [ships]. He had the audacity to come here tonight intending to assassinate our dear [governor]. Do not worry, [ladies], he was arrogant enough to come alone." The officer marches after his [men]. The [dancers] return to their banal conversations.
Front Drive A rutted drive runs north-south here, from a high spiked [gate] through the jungle to [Lafond's] [mansion]. You hide in the bushes nearby. [Dragoons], conversing quietly, [patrol] the other side of the [gate].
[Lafond's] [Bedroom] [Lafond's] [bedroom] shows all the outpourings of his megalomania.
Sitting on the [table] is a green [goblet] and a [flagon]. "In private, call me Jean, or whatever endearment you choose, once I have approved it." [Lafond] is looking into the wardrobe.
The [butler] enters, laying a silver [tray] of cold [chicken] on the [table]. "The kitchen wench has gone, your grace. I took the liberty of fetching these [myself]." He bows and leaves the [room]. "Sprinkle some [spices] on the [fowl], ma petite," [Lafond] says, donning a long brocade robe, his back to you. "They are hot, but delicious."
Sitting on the [table] is a silver [tray], a green [goblet] and a [flagon]. "Tsk. The [cook] has gone too far. She shall be 'leaving us' tomorrow." [Lafond] adjusts the lace at his neck.
[Lafond] strolls to the [table] smiling slyly. "Which [glass] was mine? I seem to have forgotten." He points at the green [goblet] and smiles in a way that does not grant you confidence. "Is this it?"
"Ah yes, of course." [Lafond] obligingly takes the green [goblet], shrugging off your lack of cooperation. He inhales deeply of the bouquet of his [wine], then turns to you. "You must think me very naive to fall for such a trick. I saw you pour something into one of these [glasses] -- although I cannot smell it." He switches [goblets], setting the green [goblet] into your nerveless grasp and taking up the other, smiling evilly. "Now you will drink from the [cup] intended for me."
Sitting on the [table] is a silver [tray] and a [flagon]. "Drink. We must not waste all night." [Lafond] pushes the [glass] toward your [mouth].
[Lafond] draws near, whispering indecencies. He caresses your lily white neck, his [fingers] ice-cold despite the tropic heat.
[Lafond] slides his [hand] up your neck and into your hair, letting it fall down your back in thick waves and tresses. He lays everything you carry on the floor.
You hear a "thump-phoosh," like someone slumping against a [wall].
The [butler] lies on the floor, prone and snoring loudly.
An eerie battle cry arises on the wind, from all sides of the [house, and Jamison's] [men] stream in from all [directions], huddling the dancers in the middle of the ballroom.
All is chaos, screaming women fainting on terrified [men]. Several of [Jamison's] scruffiest [men] round the dancers into a huddle in the center of the dance floor. [Cookie] chews anxiously at a cheroot. [Cookie] urges you, "Think agin. Any idea?"
The [pool] is roily with the writhing bodies of [Cookie] and the [crocodile].
Set deep in the [rocky] floor is an open [trapdoor]. Nicholas is spread-eagled against the wall, [shackled] in the pair of [manacles]. A [rapier] lies in the half-dark of a corner. [Crulley] [cracks] the [whip] near you, hopping you towards the open [trapdoor]. "What, afrighted of a lick o' the [whip]?"
You sense, rather than see, the rusty skeletons of old [cages] and torture devices that [line] the [walls] of this cavernous [room].
"Ye're a tasty doxy to let [slip], but no 'elp fer it."
Sounds of scraping [hook] against [stone] and curses echo out of the [well], muffled by the [trapdoor].
[Lafond's] voice is cold, lazy, "You will die, you know, [Jamison]."
Someone calls out, "We've got the [Dimsford] girl, [Governor]" -- lying, of course, since you're obviously free. But Nick glances towards the voice, missteps, and [slips] in his own blood, falling backwards to the floor, his [rapier] skittering aside.
Several feet of [rope] hang down from the [pulley], the end resting on the [railing]. [Lafond] leaps to [Jamison's] side, placing one heeled boot on the prostrate [man's] throat, the tip of his [sword] over Nick's heart. He sneers then, one [eyebrow] tilted, and moves to plunge in the [sword]. Nicholas cannot move.
Ballroom The dancers stare amazed at [Lafond's] limp body, some disbelieving, some hopeful, all stock still. The [pirates] have fled to the darkness of the lawn. [Lafond], his wig awry, sprawls across the parquet floor. You can see [breeches], a [shirt], a [flower], a large [key], a [powder horn] and a bit of [mirror] here.
You can see [breeches], a [shirt], a [flower], a large [key] and a bit of [mirror] here.
Halfway out to the [ship] is a [skiff] crowded with [men]; another [skiff] sits on the sand.
A sizable [number of dragoons] huddle at the top. [Cookie], [Lucy] and your [father] are moving towards the [skiff]. Nicholas stands alone at one edge of the [beach].
You can see a [stone] here. A [shot rings] out over the roar of the surf. Turning, you see that [Lafond] stands at the top of the [cliff], a [pistol] in each hand. "Trying to sneak out the back, cowards? You will die like your brother, Falcon. Snivelling for mercy." He [hands] one [gun] to [Crulley], standing nearby, and levels the other at [Jamison].
[Crulley] stands with the [dragoons]. [Lafond] stands halfway up the [cliff stairs].
As the [gun fires], [Cookie] throws [himself] before his [captain]. He cries out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the sand. [Lucy] runs to him. [Jamison] yells up the [cliff], brandishing his [sword]. "Fight like a [man, Lafond]. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw yours." [Lafond] sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your [lady] comes to me. You will have no need of her when you are dead." Nicholas stiffens, glances at the [dragoons] on the [cliff] above, and turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his [eyes] tell you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"
[Lucy] cleans the sand from [Quick's] quiescent face, as [Papa] stands nearby.
[Lafond] calls down to you, "My pretty doxy, do make up your mind.
Nicholas and [Lafond] are fighting. You can see a [pistol] and a [stone] here. [Lafond] immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a retreat towards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set, ignoring his wounds. [Lafond] finally loses his smile. Behind the duellists, far away atop the [cliff], you notice [Crulley] madly reloading the [pistol].
Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against [Lafond's] retreat. Their blades silently flash in the [moonlight]. [Lafond] is pressed back into the shadow of the [cliff], sweat beading on his forehead. Abruptly, [Jamison] leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his [rapier] licks neatly into [Lafond's] ribs, like a snake [slipping] into its burrow. The body of the [governor] of St. [Sinistra] convulses, as in amazement, then sags dead on the [sword]. Nicholas removes a gold [ring] from the dead [man's] [finger], throwing his own cheap copy into the surf. Far above [him, Crulley] moves down the [stairs].
[Crulley] stands, [pistol] ready, halfway up the [cliff stairs]. [Lafond] is slumped in the sand, dead. [Lucy] cleans the sand from [Quick's] quiescent face, as [Papa] sneaks up the [cliff stairs]. Nicholas walks toward you, smiling wearily.
[Crulley] is levelling the [pistol], feet apart, braced by the [cliff wall].
Each week, you spend four hours round-trip in a car to take a beginner's fencing class at the Virginia Academy of Fencing in Springfield. It's fun, you tell yourself, and it never hurts to be more active. David, on the other hand, wants to compete. Your husband wants to join the U.S. Fencing Association and begin competing in regional [tournaments] after only eight weeks of classes, when they tell people to take lessons for a whole year before competing. However, David will want what David will want, and you love your husband dearly, so...
A large, open room, with plenty of room for a few fencers to practice. Of course, tonight it's just you and [David]. A row of tall [windows] line the western [wall], and stacks of [chairs] are at either end of the long north-south room. The door to the hallway is east. An industrial-type [carpet] in garish red covers the floor.
You are finally at home. Those parties at [Stifler's] always [drive] your stomach mad. Drinks of all kind, kindly mixed by Slacks, the favourite barkeeper. With those drinks, it's always the same bad [thing]: At least 60% alcohol, [rest] either alcohol or [some] alcoholic beverage. Only food served: chips. chili chips. Lighting farts is one of your favourite hobbys at these events. [But sometimes], [some] 'hardware' finally presses down your guts to reach fresh air. [Then], always around [four] in the morning, it's time to go home. Luckily, your one room [apartement] isn't far away from [stifler's], so you get here after about [five] minutes of fresh walking. As it is the fact with walking, it does a [good] job in driving the bowels down further...
Your only place to hangout alone on this whole fucking world. Alas, as you aren't the clean type of man, the first thing that comes in view after entering here is the floor. Or, to be more precise, the things covering the floor. However, as they are mostly litter or far to messy to be of use ever again, you don't have to pay any attention at all to them. You eye around the [walls] and get hold of the other ingredients for your thing called room: A [computer], sitting on a [large oak wood desk] in the back [wall] of the room, right next to a [huge, dirty window]. To the left, a [bed] with a once clean covering and a [closet] full of things which resembled clothes once upon a time. To your right, an [oven] tries to hide masses of roaches, while the [old fridge] next to it tries to keep it's [door] closed in spite of the enormous pressure resulting in at least four different chemical reactions taking place in there. Before the [fridge], an [old cupboard] catches dust. This is your home, though, and it wouldn't be complete without a [bathroom]. So, to the south is the [door] leading to this holy place of mankind, while the [door] through which you walked in here is to the west.
It reminds you of the interior of a dumpster, but with a [steering wheel]. The [dashboard] is dusty and weathered. The vinyl [headliner] hangs down revealing it's decaying [foam backing]. The [glovebox door] hangs sadly by it's one remaining hinge. People have abandoned better [cars] than this. The road is to the north.
The [road] stretches from horizon to horizon in a straight line. It's gotta be the least traveled stretch of [road] on the planet. To the north lies a vast expanse of empty prairie. Your [car] is to the south. The [road] runs east and west. A [gravel driveway] is southeast.
The [gravel driveway] is so overgrown with brush you can scarcely tell it's there. The only trace of it is the [depressions] in the [ground] from the passing of [vehicles] a long time ago. You can see a motels ancient [sign] here. Your [car] lies to the northwest, while the [driveway] continues southeast.
You stand in the parking lot of a dilapidated and abandoned [motel]. The [asphalt] is cracked into [little pieces], like dried [out mud] after a drought. Looking north you can see the [motel] check-in [office]. The horseshoe shaped strip of flat-roofed [suites] wraps around the perimeter of the property. Westward is a heavily overgrown patch of [land], apparently once a [garden]. To the southeast a [path] leads around to behind the [suites]. The [driveway] lies to the northwest.
A small concrete [walkway] leads west through the garden to an empty [swimming pool], which is surrounded by an [wrought iron fence]. A [gate] provides access. The [weeds] grow to waist height. To the north lies the motels ramshackle tavern. Eastwards you can see the parking lot.
A pair of [heavy] wooden double [doors] stand guarding the entrance. The [lock] has been broken by looters looking for booze. [Above], a well weathered hand [painted] [sign] reads "TAVERN".
The tavern is void of furniture. A long wooden [bar] is towards the north side of the room, behind which are several dust covered glass [shelves], backed by cheesy looking gold [accented] [mirrors]. The [hardwood] floor is heavily grooved, and well worn. Westwards a set of swinging [doors] looking like they were borrowed from the set of a cheap western movie lead into a kitchen. A [chandelier] made from an old wagon [wheel] hangs from the [ceiling].
The floor bears a deep [scar] from the years of supporting a busy [bartender]. A low [countertop] supports a thick layer of dust, like a miniature [filth desert].
It appears to be a small kitchen, with a household style [range] parked against a [grease] stained [tile wall]. An old [deep fryer] is built into the counter.
The [office door] has been sealed shut with heavy [boards] nailed to the [frame]. Turquoise [paint peels] from the wooden [window frame], exposing it's rotting members.
You stand in front of a large wooden [desk], with a sloped front. It contains a large sliding [drawer]. To the north is the back room, and to the south lies the [parking lot].
It's a [small] windowless room, about the size of a prison [cell]. The cinderblock [walls] are painted a depressing institutional [yellow]. To the north is a [door] marked "[EXIT]". South, is the office.
You are standing in front of a string of [suites]. [Each] room has [scraps of wood] nailed firmly over their windows and [doors]. To the south, one of the [door] frames has rotted away, leaving it unprotected. To the north is the [garden], and the another row of [suites] lies to the west.
You are standing in a disused hotel room. The floor is covered in [purple] shag [carpeting], with a [geography of stains]. A [mildew] riddled [mattress] lies on the floor like a passed [out] derelict. The [ceiling] sports a variety of [stains] and peeling [paint]. To the south is the suites [bathroom].
The path is surrounded by tall [grass and weeds]. It leads southwest to behind the motel, and northwest to the parking lot.
Standing on an empty expanse of [gravel], you can see a path to the northeast leading [back] to the parking lot. To the west lies a grey [cinderblock] utlity [shack].
The [utility shack is] surrounded by an [eight] foot tall [chain-link] [fence], topped by barbed [wire].
You cling to the upper edge of the [fence].
You stand on a gravel covered patch of [ground]. A [small] cinderblock [utility shack stands] to the west. You can go around the back of the [shack to] the southwest.
The [small eight] by [eight] concrete room reminds you of a tomb. A musty smell wafts from the moldy interior. Mounted on the back wall is an electrical [panel] and a large [circuit breaker].
You stand in a narrow corridor between the back [wall] of the [shack and] the [fence].
Westward you can see an expanse of graffitied [cinderblock] [wall], forming the [back] of a row of suites. To the south is the [back door] to the office. A [ladder] leads up to the roof.
The [gravel] covered [roof] is spotted with patches of green [moss].
Ever since the [Provider's] sickness began, he's been all hisses and growls. Even the slightest misstep annoys him. Maybe that's why your bowl has held nothing but hard food lately. And not much of that.
Opposite a [billowy wall], a [window] looks east over a [snowy landscape]. Although the [window's] light warms you, a [cold breeze] emanates from its [base].
You enjoy curling up in the [blankets'] warm [folds], though when the [Provider] is here, you do so with care. He is mean enough when un-provoked, and does not appreciate being woken. A [cord] hangs beside a [billowy wall] to the east. A mingling of faded scents lure you northward.
Here the Provider divines food from the [cupboard's] magic [containers], and prepares it on the [ledge] above you like only a Provider can. It seems that all roads lead to your food [bowl]: there's an [alcove] to the west, a [small flap] northward, a lumpy mountain to the east, and a pile of blankets southward.
A [tree stump] pokes through the otherwise unbroken blanket of soft, powdery [snow]. A [slatted fence] traverses the [snow] to the north, while the [cottage] entrance lies southward.
Charcoal-stained [stones] form a shadowy alcove that culminates in a [chute] overhead. The strong smell of smoke is rivalled by more savory scents to the east.
You enjoy curling up in the [blankets'] warm [folds]. Light streams down through an eastern window.
It's warm and snug beaneath the blankets, though you find the [Provider's] prodigious [hind paws] to be grotesquely [hairless], smelly, and just a bit ticklish when brushed by your [whiskers].
Overlooked by a high [window] of the Provider's [cottage], a [trail] follows a north-south [stream] through a [grove of aspens].
A shadowy, east-west [path] snakes through a [tangle of gnarled oaks and elms]. Somewhere in this ancient forest, your [Rival] makes his home. You can't help hunching your shoulders, and bracing for a sudden attack.
To the east, [icicles] hang like fangs within a giant [maw of snow]. A large pair of [matching tracks] lead out of shadows of the [snowy] [mouth] and to the west. A [path] loops north and south.
Nestled under a southfacing [embankment], there are actually patches of bare [sand] along this stony [beach]. The [stream] runs swiftly past, buffeting [ice floes] against the [shore].
Through a network of burrows and tiny side-passages, a larger tunnel winds northward. Your [whiskers] indicate even it may be impassable. The air is scarce, the earth close and unstable. With no room to turn around, perhaps you should just back out the way you came in.
Beside an open [crack] in the floor stands a [glinting] [beast], the centerpiece of this [dusty] [vault]. Its glassy [eyes] and shiny [skin] reflect a [sliver of light] beneath a [huge western door]. Various [cartons and barrels] are [stacked] against the opposite [wall].
Its glassy [eyes] and shiny [skin] reflect the sunlight that streams through an opening to the west.
Suspended by [runners] on either side, the [huge door] lies flat. There's enough space to walk on top of it, although the [ceiling] is damp and cluttered with [cobwebs]. To the east, something glimmers on a [shadowy shelf].
[Stack] upon [stack, row] upon [row], of [flat, shiny eggs] crowd this dark [shelf]. The [eggs] shimmer like magic vessels. You can't help but contemplate their sealed contents.
From the inner [sill] of a [window], you look east over a [snowy landscape].
The [sky] never seemed so vast, the wind so angry, the ground so remote. Facing upwards,  you cling with all four [claws] to a slender trunk. West of you, the winds whistles through an open [window]. [Water] rushes far below, but you can hardly bear to look.
The pitched [roof] of the Provider's [cottage] affords an excellent view of the surrounding [valley]. A [stream] winds through [forest] to the east and south, while a [woodland trail] to the west links scattered [farmhouses], such as the [neighboring] one beyond a [fence] to the north.
Here the [Provider] divines [food] from the [cupboard's] magic [containers], and prepares it on the [ledge] like only a [Provider] can.
Within the close, heavy shadows, it's difficult to separate the commingled scents. Most of the arranged [boxes] appear to contain a [Provider] version of [hard food]. Indeed, your very own [monstrous sack of hard food] stands nearby.
There is just enough room in this cozy corner for the [lumpy mountain] and the [confusing black box] that faces it. The [lumpy mountain] is home to some of your finest [claw and scratch marks], though your Provider has never shared much enthusiasm for the art. The scent of your food bowl wafts in from the west.
Its glassy [eyes] and shiny [skin] reflect the moonlight that streams through an opening to the west.
Shiny, [intertwined] [tubes]--presumably his exposed [entrails]--hang from the [underside] of the [beast]. From one of his [stomachs], he slowly bleeds.
A north-south [trail] runs beneath a [canopy of chestnut trees]. You've seen giant [glinting beasts] stampede here, especially in the mornings and evenings. A [lesser track] leads east.
The gray [walls] of your [home] look as depressing as they always do. You've lived in this same place since you were a child, when your parents escaped the Exodus from the lost regions of the Underworld. Unfortunately, you have had to sell many of your personal belongings in order to stay well-fed. Consequently, the only items of any worth left here are a rumpled [bed], a wooden [cabinet], and a [table] that you use both for eating and other miscellaneous tasks. The only exit from your [home] is the doorway to the north.
Leading through the oddly-shaped [homes and workplaces] of the village of [Thran], this [pathway] looks very well-used. One major reason for this is that this is also the most well-lit spot in this area of the Underworld, due to the [Circle of Life] which exists just over this point. Your unassuming home opens to the south, and a [structure] exuding a great deal of heat lies to the north. This [roadway] extends from the west to the east.
This massive circular [tower] is very cluttered, due to an amazing lack of space. The reason for this absence of space stands in the center of this [chamber]: a massive [telescope]. [Garthan] has been working with this contraption for years now, performing his own odd form of astrology. A wooden [staircase] winds its way around the of the [tower], leading to the top.
The round [houses] that distinctly mark [Thran] fade away a little here, for the main section of the [city] lies to the west. The [sunlight] let in by the [Circle of Life] casts many [eerie shadows] on the [ground] here. Combined with the almost complete lack of noise, this area makes you a bit uneasy. The dirt [path] you are on winds from the northeast to the west.
Standing on the edge of the [river Hajalli], you can see for a long distance in both directions along the course of the raging [waters]. All of your [life] you have been warned to stay away from this [river], for indeed several tragic drownings have occurred in the history of Thran. The only well-worn [path] from this area leads away to the southwest.
From the northwest a dull chanting pervades this [point]. The [roadway] leading from the east divides into [two] smaller [paths] here, a more well-used one to the northwest, and a run-down one to the southwest. A brisk wind floats in from the southwest, making this area a bit chilly.
The stone [roadway] which intrudes from the northeast gradually fades into a rock-strewn dirt [path] in this [area]. Few people travel in this direction, except those [either] taking a shortcut to the farther stretches of the fungal fields to the northwest or those few souls daring to journey into the lost regions of the Underworld to the south. The [sunlight] coming from [Circle] to the northeast begins to be blocked in places at this point, for the [walls] of the passageway grow a bit tighter, particularly to the south.
The [stone [walls]] close in on this [path] here almost to the point of eliminating it. Very little light is let into this crevice. Just enough illumination exists, however, for you to read the [words] above the southern [tunnel] into the [rock]. Otherwise, you can move to a less claustrophobic space to the north.
Sunlight filters into your form room, where you are obliged to register [each] morning and afternoon, and falls across the [tables] as though reluctant to get itself dusty on the [linoleum] floor. The school's budgetary concerns are manifested in the [hard wooden chairs and scratched, worn desks] which surround you.
This is the History classroom, usually occupied by "Neo-Nazi" Redcough. The [tables] are arranged in straight lines with military precision, while the [wall display] is anti-Semitically asymmetrical on the back [wall]. The door is west.
The flaking, yellowish [walls] of the Geography classroom are half-obscured by [stacks of old textbooks and National Geographic] [back issues]. A [globe] of the [world] stands on Mr [Nixon's] desk at the front, and there is a [large window] at the [back].
This is the first floor of the tower. [Litter]-strewn stairs lead up and down. Westwards is the English classroom, whereas to the east is a [cupboard] owned by Bladdey, the caretaker, rumoured to contain all manner of gruesome secrets. To the north is a classroom filled with first-years.
You stand in the English classroom, blessed by its south-[facing window] with more sunlight than any other room in the tower and by its proximity to Bladdey's cupboard with an occasional cleaning. There is a [large blackboard]. The [desk] at the front of the room bears a [small snowstorm of unmarked essays].
You are at the bottom of the leaning, decrepit structure known as the tower. To one side you see [rows of dusty lockers], their numbers obscured by the fungal growth of many years. Stairs lead up, and a [door] to the east leads out of the tower.
You stand at the junction of two corridors, the main one connecting the tower (to the west) with the dining hall (east). A [trail of muddy footprints] originates from the [battered glass doors] that open north onto the playground. The reception area is south.
This is the dining hall, a constant hive of activity since the introduction of sliding timetables and their multiple lunch periods. [Teachers] cower over their [plates] as the more unruly [pupils] catapult [food] at [each] other. [Plates fly] in and out of a [hatch] to the kitchen, located to the south. The library is north, the Music room is a fair distance to the east and a pair of swing doors leads west.
Devoid of pupils and their cacophony, the Music room drowses in silence. A few [rows of rickety tables] await the next class. Some [curiously shaped instruments] are propped against the back [wall]; others lie in [cases] on the floor. A muffled hubbub comes from the dining hall, to the west.
Steam rises to obscure your vision in the stainless steel jungle that is the [school kitchen]. [Huge [piles] of plates] are stacked to one side of the [metal sink], while from somewhere around the back you hear the thuds and squeals of what is apparently a live cow being chopped up for tomorrow's beef lasagne. The dining hall is north.
Flimsy [off-white shelves] stretch from one end of the library to the other, populated with carefully selected [young adult literature]. Somewhere behind this literary jungle, you hear the assistant librarian shouting for quiet at the top of her repellent voice.
You are squelching across the freshly [tarmacked] [playground]: the only part of the school to receive a facelift in recent years and, you note wryly, the only part that didn't really need one. Parts of the [old surface] are still visible where the [playground] borders the field to the north. You can also go west to the Mound, east to the car park, or south into the main school building.
This central region of the playground is known as the [Mound], although the origins of that picturesque moniker are lost in the mists of time. The Chemistry lab is north, the Art block is west and the playground stretches to the east. There is a large [grassy] [mound] here.
Your unartistic presence defiles the Art block. [Splashes of paint] in various primary colours are liberally distributed over the [wooden desks and wall displays]. The room also boasts some [clay sculptures] which exhibit no particular form or talent - hence termed "[abstracts]". The playground is east.
You are in the main Chemistry lab. A pungent smell of burnt rubber creeps into your nostrils. The [desks and stools] bear the permanent scars of corrosive chemicals and "accidental" fires. Doorways lead east and south.
The [school] car park, bordered by a row of large [oak trees], is empty but for a few [teachers'] [cars] and a [dilapidated] [minibus]. You can go north to the languages block, west to the playground or east to the sixth form block. A [metal door] leads south to the [changing room].
The changing room is sparsely furnished with [narrow benches]. [Clothes and bags] hang above them. A single [long window] at [ceiling] height brightens the silent gloom a little. Doors lead west to the gym, east to the swimming pool, and north back outside to the car park.
The [squeaky] floor of the [gym], divided by coloured lines into courts and goal areas, bears a surreal resemblance to a London Underground map. The far [wall] is a [disorganised] [blockade of gym equipment], with a [basketball] [hoop] suspended eight or nine feet above the [mess]. A [climbing rope] hangs invitingly from the [ceiling]. The changing room is east.
You are in a small, shadowy recess behind the blackboard. The [brickwork] is damp and blotched with [mildew]. You see daylight to the south.
The [first-year] classroom is in a chaotic state. The [pupils] are doing [every] conceivable thing except work. A [substitute] [teacher] pleads ineffectually for silence. Above a [sea of paper aeroplanes], a [large window] looks out across the playground.
This is a singularly uninspiring area of the school [field], which extends north and west. The [long grass] is in need of mowing. To the south, the [field] gives way to tarmac.
You are on a [very muddy] east-west [path] leading alongside the field. The [deep-brown] monotony is divided by a few waterlogged [bicycle tracks]. The bottom of somebody's garden is visible to the west. The entrance to the Maths block is south.
This is your Maths classroom. Its cream [walls] are plastered with [unidentifiable] [pictures] made from coloured [paper] - or, as political correctness would have it, "[work] done by some of the less able students". [Unit bricks and fragments of plastic] are scattered over the floor, and a [cupboard] is set into the west [wall]. Beneath a small [skylight], a doorway leads north.
Technically out of bounds, this is the garden of some unfortunate soul whose house borders the school field. An irregular path meanders from east to west between the [rose beds]. A [toolshed] stands on one side. The school field is east.
Away towards the perimeter fence, this is one of the quieter parts of the school field, rumoured to be a UFO crash site. There is an [elliptical] [scorch mark] in the [grass] here, but no actual remains are visible since (claim the UFO advocates) the military removed all traces in the dead of night and even now are experimenting on the surviving alien. You, of course, believe none of this. The field stretches south.
There is an [elliptical] [scorch mark] in the [grass] here that has been disturbed by digging.
Loud music blasts into your ears as you stand in the [smoke]-filled sixth form common room. The [walls] are bedecked with [posters]. Various [saggy sofas] are occupied by sixth-[formers], who sit and [smoke] around the [pool table].
This is [Bladdey's] supply cupboard. In the dim electric glow, you perceive an array of [brushes, chemicals], and other [cleaning equipment].
This swanky, [richly] [carpeted] area of the school, complete with [coffee table], is the [reception], where prospective parents are led and/or misled. The [receptionist] [typing] away in the [office] next [door] glares indignantly at you whenever she makes a spelling error. An [impressive] [archway] leads north, while to the west you see a small, plain [door].
You are lost in the nightmarish staff room maze, with indistinguishable exits in all directions. Wherever you look, your eyes are accosted by [half-finished crosswords and mugs of tepid coffee]. [Pale, haggard teachers] pass you in all directions, clutching worn briefcases and faded notes for lessons that never happened.
You stand in the headmaster's office, deep within the fiendish labyrinth. The room is an opulent shrine to all that is plush and expensive. A number of [wall-mounted portraits] offset a [bookcase] and a [cabinet]. The maze is north.
You find yourself in the snake-pit of trailing [cables] that is the [computer] room. Most of the space is occupied by a collection of somewhat battered [BBC Micros], but the pride of the IT department is an early [IBM] PC. Since the IT department consists of a single part-time Art teacher, its efforts are to be praised. You can go north.
The school's [swimming pool] stretches before you, surrounded by an endless [chequerboard of blue and white tiles]. There is a grimy ring of [green] in the [pool] corresponding to a decrease in the level of [water] - popularly believed to be siphoned off by the school kitchen. A [trail of large puddles] marks the recently travelled route west from [pool] to changing rooms.
You are in the entrance lobby of the languages block, festooned with [drawings]. This is as far as you can [penetrate], because all of the classrooms are perpetually occupied. From one of them, a guttural German love song drifts out to offend your ears. You can see the car park outside to the south.
The evil-smelling area colloquially referred to as "the bogs" comprises the usual fittings, viz. [mirror, basin and urinal]. The tiled [wall] opposite is covered in badly scrawled [graffiti], and on the floor are a few [puddles] of dubious origin. You can go west. Please.
This is a dense [forest] which extends in all [directions]. To the north the [trees] appear to thin.
This is a dense [forest] with extends in all [directions]. A [rusting, barbed wire fence], blocks the way north.
The is a dense [forest] which extends in all [directions]. A gap in a [fence] leads north
This is an overgrown north-south [dirt road] bounded by forest to the east and west. The [road] continues north toward a low hill.
You are inside a small [guard hut], barely large enough to protect one or two sentries from the elements. A door leads [outside].
You are at the south face of a large escarpement. A [dirt road] runs east and west around the [hill] and south.
You are on a [dirt] path curving around the base of a rocky [hillside]. The path extends west and northeast.
You are on the eastern edge of a rocky [hillside]. A large, dark tunnel extends westward into the [hillside]. Although it appears attempts were made to demolish it, it would be possible to climb over the [debris]. A [dirt road] extends southwest, curving [out] of sight around the [hillside].
You are on top of a large rock [pile] just inside the mouth of a large tunnel. to the west, the [pile] drops precipitously into the darkness. To the east, the [pile] descends to a dirt path.
The eastern end of a demolished tunnel. A large [pile of debris] blocks the east.
This is a small staff room. Exits lead north and south. To the east is a [door] to an [office].
This is a dank lavatory. A doorway leads [out] to the north. North of Bathroom is Staff Room.
This is a [small office] .
This is a four way junction. A wide passage leads north. Others lead south, east and west. A [tin sign] above the north passage says "Richard I".
This is a huge chamber carved [out] of the native limestone. Rusting [engine] blocks in various states of completion, sit on test [stands]. The cavern continues north and there is an exit to the south.
This end of the north end of a cavernous undergroud chamber. There are several [work benches] here.
This is a wide tunnel extending south off an an east-west tunnel to the north. At its southern end, the tunnel has collapsed. A [small] passageway extends off to the west.
This is a [small] roon with various rusting [machines].
This is the western end of a damp tunnel leading east. At the western end, passages fork off to the northwest and southwest. A [tin sign] over the southwest passage says "Richard II".
You are on a [ladder] half-way up a ventilation shaft.
You are at the top of a ventilation shaft. a metal [cupola], held in place by large [bolts], caps the shaft.
This is the top of an airshaft. Above you, an open hole leads [outside].
This is the rather non-descript waiting room for people who do business with Mr R.P. Jacobson, one of the richest, most powerful men in the world. Of course, it is empty now. Everyone has gone home to celebrate the new year in their own fashion. You can still see the light on in Mr. Jacobson's [personal office], however. It is well known that he spends the New Year here every year; Watching the midnight fireworks from his 30th story perch. The [door] stands in front of you, on the north [wall] of the lobby.
The office is decorated with portraits of Jacobson [himself]. Posed with celebrities and politicians, his hard features seem to stare down at you from every [wall]. The carpet is a light marroon color, and the soft lighting makes this feel like a place where heavy business can be done in comfort. Looking around, you see no sign of Mr. Jacobson. The office is empty of people, although the [desk] gives off the feeling that somebody was here just recently. An open [window] on the far [wall] provides a light breeze.
The [deck] of the [sailboat] is small, but cozy. [Granny] has opened up the fold-[out table] and is laying [out] hands of [solitaire], while [Fran and Bart] amuse themselves in other ways, waiting for you to get the boat moving again. A [hatch] leads down, and the so-called "aft [deck]" is south of you (you were never good with those nautical directions).
If you thought the main [deck] was small, then this is nothing more than a ledge tacked on to the end of the [boat]. The [sails] separate you from the main [deck] to the north. Off to the south is your family's [cabin].
This is the main living area of the [sailboat]. There's a [tiny kitchen] area, a [tiny table, shelves] built into the wall, and [curtains] held in place by velcro over the [tiny windows]. North is a closet of a bathroom, while to the south is the sleeping cabin. A narrow [ladder] leads up to the [hatch] and the main deck.
A [curtain] separates the galley from this "[room]." Really, it's just a [bed] that stretches from wall to wall, large enough for [two] if you're really well acquainted. The galley is to the north.
"[Head]" is what they call a [bathroom] at sea. This one is teensy. The usual [bathroom] items are all here, but you can barely seem them through the fog of claustrophobia that hits you when you squeeze yourself into this room. South takes you back to the galley.
Even here, your ascent was accompanied by insipid [elevator] music; it's a relief to be out in this marbled antechamber. Brass [plaques] indicate which direction is which -- numbers 2601-2606 to the east, and 2607-2612 to the west. On the north [wall] is a large [mural] of the New York skyline.
A mirror of its eastern counterpart, this [corridor] is set with six -- no, seven -- [doors]. Numbers [2607] through [2609] running east to west along the north [wall], unit [2610] at the west end of the hall, and finally a [maintenance] [closet and apartments] [2611 and 2612] running west to east on the south side of the hallway.
A mirror of its western counterpart, this [corridor] is set with six -- no, seven -- [doors]. Numbers [2601] through [2603] running west to east along the north [wall], unit [2604] at the east end of the hall, and finally a [maintenance] [closet and apartments] [2605 and 2606] running east to west on the south side of the hallway.
Well-[dressed people] mill about, sampling [wine and hors d'oeuvres]. Some of them peer out the [picture window] to the east; others are coming or going between here and the south end of the room.
There are more [people] here, gathered around the [large-screen] [television] [set] in the south [wall]. They're moving in small clusters, carrying on private conversations of their own. A door that looks like a bathroom is west.
Surrounding you on all sides are [tall trees, treacherous] [shadows, and fallen logs]. A faint [sound of frogs] in the [background] together with a [steady dripping] add to the already dismal setting.
This [stage] is bare of props, unlike yours. People are jammed onto the benches in the area of the theatre beyond the [orchestra pit].
You are in a [computer] lab. It is dark. All around you are [computers] with monitors shut off. The [computers] are all locked (except one). The only [windows] are to the east. They are covered with blinds that allow little light in. There is one [door] next to the [windows], it is locked. There is another [door] to the west. It is also locked.
A [sandy] [[sea]-shor]e. Small waves roll almost to your feet. To the North lies a [mysteriously] [inside-out] [house]; the [rooms] and their [contents pointing] in all directions.
You think you see something on [Sam's] cheek. Is it a bit of ketchup from this morning's scrambled eggs? Exudate from a popped pimple? No, no... it is ketchup. But is that a grey hair next to it? A grey whisker in the middle of [Sam's] face, a thin island in the midst of a pasty ocean? No! A grey whisker, swaying slightly in the breeze, sprouting from a mole. You find [yourself] reflexively touching the corresponding portion of your own face. [Sam's] hand grabs a napkin and holds it up, selfconsciously, and then you hear a sound -- is [Sam] sobbing? No: [Sam] is snickering. Specifically, at you. "Oh, my God," [Sam] starts, "how can you breathe at all around that giant fosilized snot-rock blocking your nostril?" You flush hot with dismay. (Anyhow, it's easy: you just wheeze and whistle a lot.)
This is a spartan [apartment], but it's your [apartment], at least until you get evicted for failing to pay the rent. The sun-bleached [lino] floor bears an assortment of [dark rectangles], shadows of a more decadently furnished past. A single [framed photo] hangs on the wall beside the front [door]. Little else adorns the room, just an [old futon] and a slow spinning [ceiling fan] suspended from the [impractically] [high ceiling]. Above the [fan] is the offending [smoke alarm], blaring so loud you can barely think.
There's just enough room to open the [fridge] without hitting the [gas oven] on the [opposite wall]. The [kitchen counter] is tiny. Between the [square sink] and the giant [stone Buddha], there is just enough room to burn [toast]. [Buddha's] gaze is fixed firmly on the [toaster]. He knew this was going to happen!
It's a simple [slab of concrete] separated from the [neighbouring] [balconies] by [faded red-brick] [walls]. A [nearby oak tree] gives ample shade and privacy during summer, though right now the winter [branches] expose a breathtaking [view] of the [city], marred only slightly by the presence of an overflowing [ashtray]. A cold breeze carries the chatter of your [neighbours] up from the lawn 3 stories below.
The [extractor fan] is broken and [mold spots] have been gradually spreading across the [ceiling] ever since you moved in. A [curtainless] [shower] crowds the [plain white toilet] and a [cracked wash basin] sits in the shadow of a poorly placed [medicine cabinet]. In the corner is a lonely [rubbish basket].
There's really not much in this poorly lit, cobwebbed corner of the [apartment]. Just [cobwebs] and an old front-loading washer/[dryer] with a busted [porthole door]. You haven't been able to use it in months, so you've been taking your laundry to the coin-op down the road instead.
Wowzers. The [Count] opted for simplicity and vague elegance in his [treasure vault antechamber], choosing to dress the [walls], floor, and [ceiling] alike in money-[green marble tiles] delicately flecked [with gold]. Apart from yourself and the stupendously [locked] [vault door] to the south, there's nothing here. [Except] for... THE [KEYS].
A white room, the [walls] are decorated with roundels. There is a constant hum in the background. The area is illuminated with a soft light. In the centre of the room is the hexagonal [control console], on which is a [red lever], a black [switch], a [grey button], and a [radiation meter]. To the south, there is a short passage, leading to a room beyond
This corridor runs south from the control room, with an opening halfway along the west [wall].
A [bedroom], the [walls] decorated in the same roundels as everywhere in the TARDIS. The only exit is to the North
A room stuffed full of [souvenirs] from your travels. Most of it is [junk], but you hate to throw things away; you never know if they might prove to be useful in the future (or past).
I am standing beside a bus shelter on the [outskirts] of Steignton. Exits are North and East.
I am [outside] a [tea shop]. [Above] the [door] an emblazoned [sign] proudly [displays] the longevity of the [company's] continued business. Exits North and West.
I am on the village green beside a [pond]. Exits lead North, South, East and West.
I am [outside] the general [store]. The [store] is closed. Exits are East and South.
The [pond] is almost dry and the [yellowed rushes] stand bowed.
I am inside the [tea-shop]. An [assistant] is busy behind the [counter].
You saved for months to go on your first cruise to Iceland, and now you're in the [middle] of the North [Atlantic]... just not in the way you'd planned to be. Only halfway through your week-long vacation, the ship's captain announced that the hull had been compromised (curiously, he failed to specify how it happened) and instructed all passengers to board the [lifeboats] for evacuation. You're in one of the small [lifeboats] now, being lowered onto the water with nine other people.
This is one of the ship's smaller [lifeboats]. Only ten people fit on it. At least it looks like there's a [storage bay] stocked for situations like this.
You find [yourself] in a dim [room]. The walls are built of red brick, covered with [torches]. An ominous gust of wind flows through the west [window]. Sounds of clashing [swords] and war-cries can be heard from [outside]. Silver moonlight pours in. Your city is under siege.
You are engulfed in pure darkness. You feel your way around the [room], only to come back to where you started - very frustrating. A staircase leads upward. (Maybe if you had something to [light] your way...)
Embroidered [tapestries] cover the walls. Sounds of battle can be heard from beyond the [gate]. The ground seems to tremble from the footsteps of the enemy army. You pause a moment to take it all in. This has been your home for as long as you can remember.
Gusts blow violently, almost pushing you off the edge. A staircase leads down. Your nation's [flag] flaps violently in the wind. It's exhilarating.
A dark [tunnel] goes further than you can see. A cloaked man stands at  the foot of the steps. He is The [Keeper].
The [river] below flows vilolently beneath your feet. An army of thousands is waiting at your castle's [doorstep]. The [General] has crossed the [bridge].
The members of the Fortean Society of New England ? a collection of caricatures, characters, monsters, and myths ? mingle in groups in the bright [ballroom]. You thought that Robin Hood was up on the stage, but the flute hanging from his neck suggests that it is instead the Pied Piper of Hamelin playing the music. The [nun] smiles at you from the refreshment table along one wall. Double doors open [out] into the hall, which leads downstairs to the [Fly Eye].
[Five monitors] sit [against] the back wall, [each] receiving signals from [cameras] in [five] different [rooms]. Rather than for use as security, though, the Society is hoping for an experience that will make it into the Journal of Spirituality and Paranormal Studies and footage that will raise the [eyebrows] of even the most stone-faced skeptics. Below and beside the [pentagon] of screens, [Music] plays from a [laptop], which  shows an open [web browser]. On [monitor] 1, a black widow spider approaches one side of the stage in the [ballroom] while the sasquatch and a leprechaun chat from the [playroom] seen in [monitor] 5. You can hear their faint voices because the room is wired for electronic voice phenomena, especially of children. A medicine man and Rasputin wander around the [attic] on [monitor] 3.
You are standing on the front [path], to the east of your cottage. The [path] runs from the door behind you to the old wrought-iron gate which leads out into the lane. A [second], more [well-trodden] [path] leads around the cottage to the north.
The cool evening air of the [garden] is refreshing and welcome. The sky is a pinkish red, dotted with clouds brilliantly lit by the setting sun. Around the edges of the patch of [dark green] lawn are an assortment of flowers and shrubs, displaying their brightly-coloured flowers against a background of [greens]. In the northwest corner is a [large, gnarled oak tree], and against the [wall] of the [house] to the south is an [ivy-covered bench]. On the far side of the [rosebush] is a [small pond].
You're in a [plush bedroom]; apparantly the owner liked creature comforts. The sole exit is down.
You're at the entrance to this grand estate, where a large [red door] to the [outside]. I hope you aren't planning on leaving before you solve this mystery! The only way to go from here is north.
You're in a library covered wall-to-wall with computer [books]. There are exits west and down.
You're in a dungeon. Hmm, this isn't the normal kind of room you see in today's houses. On the wall is written "Xyzzy isn't a magic word." The only way [out] of here is to go up.
The Carnival has an eerie silence to it at night. A breeze blows a flurry of flyers and some broken streamers. The absence of voices and laughter is highly apparent, although it seems that someone has left some of that cheery circus music on. However, it seems [out] of place in the dark. Some of the lights flicker above you. What a classy joint.
The shacks of the Midway have already been partially assembled. The shanties aren't that impressive, however, even in their broken down stage. Colored signs are hanging loosely by a few nails and you can see the pieces of a "TEST YOUR STRENGTH!" notice hazardly shoved in a crate. A [ring toss booth] is still fully intact. You can see the looming shape of the Green [Tent] to the north.
The [Green Tent] is a great domed creation with [two] horn-like projections from the top. They seemed to be suspended in the air, defying gravity and swaying gently in the wind. You wonder briefly how the [tent] could be constructed to support that. There is a large round opening as an entrance to the [tent]. The dirt [outside] is heavily trampled, indicating its popularity. North from here is a squat building and to the west, there is a Purple [Tent].
It is a cheap [desk]. Guess Li ain't the kind of guy to care about what other people think. ... Or the Ringmaster is a super Scrooge. And uh, there's not even a drawer... The circus must be worse off than you thought.
The Steel Platform is only a couple of feet long and even shorter in width. It makes your stomach queasy. Ignoring your natural instinct of survival, you look around enough to see the entirety of the Green [Tent] here.
It is a short, squat building. It seems to be a part of the fairgrounds, and not actually owned by the circus. The words "TECHNICAL SERVICE" have been stenciled unevenly on the side. This place just keeps getting better and better. To the east, you can see what appears to be a horse corral. To the north, there is the Black [Tent].
It is a small, violet [tent] made of a thick, sparkly velour. This appears to be the fortune teller's [tent]. It smells thickly of flowers and chai tea, although it's not an altogether unpleasant scent. The fortune teller is here. She is a small, quiet young [woman]. There seems to be something sad about her, but she has a perpetually fierce, defensive expression on her face.
The [horse] corral is circluar in shape, and a beautiful, dark beast runs energetically. There are [two] sets of concentric fences. The inner circle keeps the [horse] contained. There aren't any additional buildings here. You wonder where the stunt rider keeps any of her possessions.
You are standing at the west end of a wide, oval, rickety, wooden roller coaster. This hunk-a-junk has seen better days. There's not a lot to see here. To the west is where you can board the coaster, and to the south there's the Black [Tent].
The Black [Tent] is wide and open. It smells of soap and raw meat. To the north is the back of the rollercoaster, and to the east there is the House of Mirrors.
The [tent's] huge, billowing sides flap gently in the breeze. It seems to be made of silk - you can almost hear how soft the material is in the air. Beyond it, you can see what looks like a horse corral.
This short corridor, running from west to east, certainly would not look [out] of place in a 5-star hotel or an old mansion. The [walls] are reddish-brown and the floor and [ceiling] are wheat-colored. A [door] is to the west, and another to the east. On the northern wall are [two doors], one of them to the west, labeled "[Bedroom]" and the other one to the east, labeled "[Study]". A small [picture] hangs on the southern wall, livening up the room.
Moonlight shines through the window, illuminating the [bed] upon which your '[owner'] [Tim], lies sleeping.
This place is exactly like the bedroom of Tim, except larger. Another point of significant difference is the [vcr]/tv [combination] which is currently the focus of your interest.
The barren [walls], the scattered [books], and the splendid view of sunlight coming through the [window] fills you with a wonderful feeling of being [back] where you belong.
Here you find yourself at the top of a short flight of [stairs]. If you didn't live here, the many [doors] extending from here might seem intimidating. However, daily routine reminds you that your room is to the east, your [brothers'] rooms to the north, and the [bathroom] to the west. A stairway leads back down.
Funny thing, it is: the upstairs [bathroom] is actually clean for once. Indeed, it is usually quite cluttered, being in a more remote part of the house that's rarely visited by parents. It seems that Mom has stopped by recently, however. The only exit is to the east.
You're in the main hallway. East is the front [door] (very useful for leaving). The kitchen is north, the master bedroom is to the south, the living room is just to the west of you, and stairs lead to higher grounds.
This is the center of the house. There are a few [pictures] hanging on the [wall] that add to the atmosphere. A soft light enters through the [windows], filling the room with a pleasant glow. To the east is the main hallway. The dining room is to the north.
This serves as Mom and Dad's room. There's a [big mirror] on the [wall] opposite the [doorway]. The hallway waits behind you to the north.
long [description] of your location.
At End Of [Road] You are standing at the end of a [road] before a small brick [building].
At [Hill] In [Road] You have walked up a [hill], still in the [forest]. The [road] slopes back down the other [side] of the [hill]. There is a [building] in the distance.
Inside [Building] You are inside a [building], a [well house] for a large [spring].
You have walked up a [hill], still in the [forest].
In A Valley You are in a valley in the [forest] beside a [stream] tumbling along a [rocky] [bed].
In [Forest] You are in open [forest], with a deep valley to one side.
In [Forest] You are in open [forest] near both a valley and a [road].
At [Slit] In [Streambed] At your feet all the [water] of the [stream] splashes into a 2-inch [slit] in the rock.
Outside [Grate] You are in a 20-foot [depression] floored with bare [dirt].
You are in open [forest], with a deep valley to one side.
It's a very old [cabin]. The roof is saggy and the floor boards creak. You can tell this got a lot of use but was abandoned a long time ago. You can see:
There are a few different [paths] leading away from the deteriorating [cabin]. One has been recently tavelled on and the others have not been touched in some time.
There is an [old well] in the middle of the clearing. Just by the look of it you can tell that is has long since been [out] of water.
This huge, bare living room occupies about half the mansion's [ground] floor.
This is the mansion's spacious [ground]-floor antechamber. The [wallpaper] is [peeling and bits of plaster] have fallen from the [ceiling] here and there. There is a [stairway], stable enough to ascend. The big area to the w must have once been a separate room, but the demolition crew seems to have already taken out a [wall]. A living room is e. On the s side is the front [door]. A [Dumpster] has been dumped here.
The lobby of the mansion's initial floor - the one [above] the [ground] floor - is an ordinary and fairly well-maintained room. There are some things scrawled on the [ground] here, in the contractor's handwriting: '1 object' is written to the n, while toward the other three exits on this floor '2' is scrawled. The [stairway] that runs d to the foyer turns and continues u, to the next floor. The constrained passages to the n, e, w, and s look as if they might spell trouble. Or perhaps they simply spell 'NEWS.'
This lobby, allowing access to the rooms of the next-to-next-to-top floor, is in good shape. It is very similar to the lobby [below], although the [ceiling] may be a bit lower. Here there are only three passages. Two of them (to the n and e) are normal passages, but one, to the s, is oddly constrained. It has an [ominous sign above] it. The main [stairway] leads d, while another [staircase], straight and narrow, allows passage u to the next floor.
At this level the house is neither as broad or as long as it is on the [ground] floor. There seems to only be one other room on this floor, through a constrained [double doorway] to the w. One thin, unpainted [stairway] leads u into darkness from here. Another one, almost as narrow, leads d.
You are standing beside your [car], parked in a small gravel [parking] area. Light streams onto the [ground] in patches, mottled by the shade of the gum trees high [above]. Surrounding you is an assortment of [vehicles]. A gravel path leads north to the front door of the clubhouse, while to the west stands a large maintenance workshop.
A [centrefold] is taped to the wall. A large wooden [workbench] runs along one wall. [Brad] is here, sitting on a [barrel] to one side of the front door.
This must be the maintenance [workshop] of the flying club. An overpowering smell of oil and grease fills the air, and the [ground] is oily underfoot. Discarded [aircraft parts], old drawings and grease tins lie on every flat surface.
The gravel path from the east comes to an end here, at the edge of a grassy area. A well-trodden path in the grass leads to a large maintenance workshop to the south. Lined up along the field are a number of light [aircraft] of varying types and sizes. Another [aircraft], a [Warrior], is involved in flying circuits in the area. A [fuel pump] stands nearby.
You are standing on a gravel path in the [front garden] of the clubhouse. The club itself is a small, single-storey building painted white - you squint as the bright sunlight reflects off the walls. The [front door] of the club is to the north. The gravel path runs east to a side [garden] and west to an open grassy area where you can see several light aircraft tied down. To your south is a gravel car parking area.
A [corpse] is here, lying face-up on the [ground].
The path from the west ends here in a [small secluded] corner of the [garden], surrounded on the other [three] sides by thick [bushes]. You realise that this is the [scene] of the [murder]. You're not sure if the air is cooler here or if the shiver down your spine is your sudden fear.
You are now standing in a dimly lit [hallway] inside the club house. Bright light streams in from the open door to the south leading back [out] to the front garden. Sounds of revelry can be heard emanating from the lounge room to the west. To the north stands the office.
The [lounge room] of the club is spacious and comfortable. Couches line the walls and a large bar stands at one side of the [room]. The bar stools are all occupied by an Nordik-looking extended [family]. The head of the [family, Haagen Das], is busy telling a long (and presumably hilarious) story to the rest of the [clan] in broken English. The rest of the [clan] is laughing uproariously and pouring beer over [each] others' heads. [Cecil] is sitting at a nearby table, engrossed in some paperwork.
The club [office] is small but well-appointed - plush carpets, expensive furniture, the lot. You suspect that an interior decorator once spent a lot of time, effort and money to achieve this professional and fashionable effect. Unfortunately, his or her efforts have been ruined by the pilots, who over the years have covered the walls with a number of [posters] - completely ruining the colour scheme. The sounds of the partying occurring elsewhere in the clubhouse are muffled here - a blessing for anyone intending to get serious work done.
The [cabin] is fairly [non-descript], and quite [small]. It has a [bed], a [dressing table], a [hideous abstract picture] on the [wall] and an [immense potted plant] by the [door]. Since there are no windows you guess you must be on the lower deck of the ship. There is a [door] to the east.
Porter Square [Station] is vast and deep, like some colossal cave [discovered] beneath the asphalt above and hewn into a great [dome]. The [walls] are smooth and red, like [clay], but the whole [station] is full of the smell of hot [plasteel], like the rest of the T. In the middle of the [platform] is a large [display sign], red and gold [trains] moving along the [virtual map] it [displays].
The [escalators] curve up and around the interior of the [dome], slowly carrying you up toward the surface. The [station's] [prism] was designed to illuminate the platform, and as you rise past the area of its focus the whole grows dimmer. The muted grey dusk of the surface world, once smothered by the artificial [light], slowly takes precedence and becomes the sole source of illumination.
The [station's] aboveground enclosure is tiny compared to its cavernous platform. The [escalators] exit into a square [greenhouse]-like [structure] about twelve meters long and wide. The [glass] is covered in [dirt and salt], but you can still see some of the square through them. Heavy [doors] lead out into the cold; around them is a red plastic [frame], indicating a [PeopleTrack] [sensor].
Porter [Square], the intersection of Mass Ave and Somerville Ave, has been going downhill for a few years now. The [glass and plasteel station] in the middle of the [square] has long since lost its [status] as a symbol of progress. It's caked in [salt and dirt], just like [everything] else. Several second-rate [shops] line up along the road, along with the local [clinic];  they're all old [buildings], and unlike the train [station] they've been unable to escape the ravages of rust and [graffiti]. Somerville continues to the east, and Mass Ave runs northwest and south.
This is a long, wide street, usually close to deserted. Even during rush hour, few people head out this way. Along one side, a deep, [fenced]-off [ravine] runs east-west. Twice daily, commuter trains pass through it. For the most part, it's dead. Across the avenue is a line of crumbling apartment [houses], including yours, up a few [steps] to the north.
The [walls] of the stairwell are bare plaster. A scraped-up wooden [door] leads into the empty first floor apartment. Creaky unfinished [stairs] lead up.
The [plaster] here is cracking, and the [banister] coming out of the [wall]. The [wet stairs] continue up toward your apartment.
Two [cops] mill around the apartment, looking through your things and leaving tracks across the floor. The [bathroom door] lies open to the north.
The Guatemalan countryside rolls in gentle hills amid bright rainforest. You can hear [parrots and monkeys] in the nearby jungle. The road stretches to the north, where the Guatemalan Insane Asylum stands, and to the south, where you came from.
The [guest bedroom] is uninspiring and unadorned, apart from a decrepit [rug] covering the [stone] floor. The small amount of [light] entering through the [window] does little to disperse the depressing atmosphere created by the dark [wooden] panelling that covers the [walls] and the [large closet] opposite your [bed]. The [door], slightly tilted, revolves on rusty iron [hinges] that manage to remain in place only by some suspension of the laws of physics.
The gentle sound of [snow] against the [window pane] suggests that it's cold outside, and you're glad to be here in the warmth. The drawing-room is reflected in the large [looking-glass] on the [wall] above the [mantelpiece], and a very comfortable room it is too, with a warm [hearth], a [soft rug] and an [arm-chair] that you can curl up and sleep in.
The living room of your mother's house has been decorated exactly the same for as long as you can remember. The same old [couch], for example. Your mother is in the kitchen to the north, preparing some sandwiches for lunch. Other rooms stretch off in usefully [cardinal] directions.
It's an open air [carpark] overlooking the [marina], to the north-west. There's a great looming [gate] in the way, though. South-east is the playground, North-east is the wharf, and south is the Park Green.
The wharf is chiefly white, but time has flaked away a fair amount of the paint. From here you can see numerous [sand islands] and boats. It's a beautiful sight. To the south-west is the car park, and south is the playground.
Ah, the [playground] brings back memories. Jail in the steel maze. Swinging on the swings. Naturally, the [playground] itself hasn't changed a bit, and is still here with its underwater-themed jail maze. West of here is the Park Green and north-west is the car park. North is the wharf.
The glorious Park Green astounds you. [Tall trees] surround you. To the south is the Central Business District, to the north is the car park and to the east is the playground.
Thick black [smoke] rises from the back [wall] of the [stable], pooling at the [ceiling] before pouring down the opposite side and out the [stable door]. It brings with it a searing heat that steals your breath away.
Though the [room] is filled with [chatter, and couples] still dance late into the night, it does not take a trained eye to see that the two [parties] keep entirely to themselves. [Almeri] to the left, [Tanith] to the right, barely so much as looking at [each] other except when etiquette demands. A breeze blows through the [tall windows], the [curtains] drifting gently to reveal glimpses of the [gardens] beyond, and on the [balcony] the [band] still plays.
Standing at the back, so as not to disturb the [band], the ball room below is hidden from sight, and the music drowns [out] the dull buzz of conversation.
The light from the [ball room] casts long shadows across the [neatly trimmed lawn]. [Shadowy hedges] rise up on all sides, the gloom seeming to seep from their bases to engulf the carefully arranged [shrubs and plants].
Though you would not normally be in such lowly quarters, none of the servants appear to be here to notice. The remnants of the earlier banquet have been cleared away, leaving only [empty tables] and a [cauldron simmering] over the [embers] of a [fire].
You have entered Communications [Mode]. The following locations are equipped with communication [outlets]: PRISM Project Control Center (PPCC) Research Center Rooftop (RCRO) Dr. Perelman's Office (PEOF) PRISM Facility Cafeteria (PCAF) Maintenance Core (MACO) World News Network Feed (WNNF) To activate a specific outlet, submit the associated code. 7:07pm
[PRISM] Project Control Center (PPCC) Research Center [Rooftop] (RCRO) Dr. [Perelman's] Office (PEOF) [PRISM] Facility Cafeteria (PCAF) Maintenance Core (MACO) World News Network Feed (WNNF) To activate a specific [outlet], submit the associated code. 7:08pm
A small room build [out] of some unused space in the universe--good thing there's space to spare. The walls (if you can call them that) are a featureless expanse of gray that seems to vanish into the distance. The previous occupant must not have had enough time to start warping the space into a more hospitable environ. A [swirling portal] is the only way [out].
You are standing in the center of what appears to be a roman camp, though long since converted to the uses of their successors. It is apparently abandoned though the vegetation is only just starting to encroach upon the trampled ground. In all directions you can see various structures and beyond them a [crude palisade]. A [wooden tower] stands to one side. The [swirling portal] leads back to the vortex.
To the southwest stands a squat [wooden] structure. Large windows are line the north side and the east is half open to the world with only a [small wooden gate] provides a sense of enclosure. The earth to the east is packed into a dirt road and to the north and northeast you can spot other buildings in the camp.
Ruts in the dry ground continue to the south to a gap in the [palisade] where a [gate] stands. The wall continues to either side vanishing between the [camp] structures. The rest of the [camp] is arrayed to the north.
You stand at the eastern edge of the camp in the shade of a large wooden structure with a [massive door]. You can make [out] a few of the other structures of the camp off to the east. Along one wall there is a procession of small circles of shorter grass ending at a few rotting [barrels].
The world is indeed made of shades of grey. To the southeast is a perfect example of the fuzziness between hutness and non-hutness. While it does boast [four] walls, such large windows have been cut to leave little more than the support beams remaining. Similarly the roof is built around a large chimney leaving very little roof left to consider. The camp continues to the north and west.
Extending from where you stand north and east up to the pallisade, is a bare [patch of ground]. Several [rectangular] [areas] are hinted at be the patterns of the returning [grass] and marred earth. Structures rise to the south and west.
To the west stands an unimposing structure, low to the ground with canvas walls. Around the edges however, the canvas has begun to peal aside and you can see a much more intricate structure. The canvas hides a wooden structure with the seams carefully sealed. Facing you is a [wide door], almost large enough to admit a half-dozen people at a time. The camp opens up around with the nearest structures a decent walk away.
Extending from where you stand north and west up to the pallisade, is a bare [patch of ground].
A large [tent] stands to the north. The heavy cloth is weathered and torn in places but still remains largely intact. A pair of standards flank the [entrance] as attentive guards. [Two] strips of [canvas] provide an appearance of privacy for the occupant. The camp stretches [out] everywhere else, a tower rises from a large open area to the south, with buildings on either side.
The [tent] has an illusion of spaciousness, probably due to the lack of furnishings. There is certainly space for them and imprints on the ground remain, but only a [wooden table] stands here.
Around you is a small [forge] not unlike the hasty reconstructions found at the local fair. The bare necessities to demonstrate metalwork: the [anvil], the [forge] and the large doorway via which you escape the heat.
There is a [tree] here, decorated with [ornaments] and surrounded by [piles of presents]. There is also a [table] off to one side. The [closet] is to the southeast.
This is the [closet] where you will be spending the night. It is full of things that you don't need to think about right now.
The [foggy light] coming from the [grates] on the [top] half of the [stairwell] looks like a cascade of [dusty milk]. You are standing just mere feet from your house [entrance], above the first [step outside].
The [faint lights] get [fainter] here. A sturdy [door] opens on the Avenues, to the north. A [flight of stairs] moves up to your front [door].
The vivid [pink] of the [Monarch sky] paints an eternal [sunset] and washes the street and the buildings in a somewhat romantic nuance. The [door] to your condominium lies south of here, reflecting the [three [suns]] like a gigantic kaleidoscope. The [Avenue] runs [out] of sight in every direction, finding [outlets] in a handful of other busy [streets]. The one you need runs east, towards the train station.
Here the [street] forks in two different branches, one disappearing southeast into the train station, the other going on to the east. To the west lies your house.
The cyanotic, vibrating light of the station stands as a formal counterweight to the usual pink of the open air. [People] from all the country crowd the hall, piling up like chickens in stocks. The loud whistle of the incoming and departing [trains] dopplers through the place and drills into your ears. The [rails] cut the earth in two further south, while a more breathable atmosphere breaks in through the entrance, northwest and up from here.
You are floating, inert, in the centre of a huge chamber. In front of you, just [out] of reach, is the vast observation [window]; above you is the floor.
St. Catherine's has an excellent gymnasium for its [female] students, but of course it's of little use to you. The only reason you're here is because your [friend Amy] practically begged you to come with her.
The hallway outside the gym is nothing special. [Some trophies]. The [Christian cross]. An [aquarium of fish]. The hallway continues south, the gym is west, the chapel east, and the exit to the street is to the north.
The south end of the hallway is even less interesting than the north end, except for a [sewer grating] in the floor.
You are sitting in the middle of a wide open field on a beautiful spring afternoon. The [sky] is clear with only a few [clouds] hovering overhead and the [sun] is hovering bright, making the details of the landscape crisp and clear. There is no breeze but you still feel pleasantly cool. A few [flies] buzz menacingly around your [picnic basket] which lies open at your side. To the north is a [house]. To the west is a [lake]. To the south and east are open fields as far as the eye can see.
[Traven] had come ashore at midnight, after a hazardous search for an opening in the reef. The small motorboat he had hired from an Australian pearl-diver at Charlotte Island subsided into the shallows, its hull torn by the sharp coral. Exhausted, [Traven] walked through the darkness among the dunes, where the dim [outlines] of bunkers and concrete towers loomed between the palms. The shore seemed to extend forever to the North and South, offering no escape from the booming waves. He knew he needed to finally escape from the sea.
The sound of the waves became unbearable to [Traven].
South Junction You're standing in front of the [house] where you spent many of your summers as a youngster.
Southeast Junction This is the southeastern corner of a large backyard whose main feature is an elaborate [garden]. The stone walkway splits in three [directions] here: north, along the perimeter of the [garden]; south, around the side of the [house]; and west, where the walkway ends at a couple of steps leading up.
Patio This is a large fieldstone patio spanning the entire width of the back of the [house].
Southwest Junction This is the southwestern corner of a large backyard whose main feature is an elaborate [garden]. The stone walkway splits in three [directions] here: north, along the perimeter of the [garden]; south, around the side of the [house]; and east, where the walkway ends at the [foot] of a couple of steps.
[Garden], South You're standing on a stone walkway in [Aunt Hildegarde's] much envied [garden] where [she] would spend hours tending to her [flowers], bushes and [trees].
You suggested pretending to be wild African animals and climbed a tree and began to screech as if a baboon while Cousin [Herman] ran off toward the roses shouting something about being a rhinoceros.
[Garden], East You are in the overpoweringly fragrant [rose bush] section of the [garden]. As you admire the [roses] you notice one somewhat sickly [rose bush]. Something about the sight of this particular [rose bush] makes you feel a bit queasy.
[Garden], North You are in the [orchid] section of the [garden].
[Garden], West You're standing on a stone walkway in the [tulip] section of the [garden].
Entrance to Hedge [Maze] This is the entrance to the hedge [maze].
Northeast Junction In this corner of the backyard you can make out the enormous hedge, which is part of the estate's hedge [maze].
Top Landing This is a rickety landing at the top of a long flight of old, wooden [stairs] leading down to the beach far below. You and Cousin [Herman] would race down these [stairs] in the summertime to see who would get to the water first. Usually Cousin [Herman] would trip you and win. A path in the grass leads west.
Middle of Beach [Stairs] You're about halfway down the steep [staircase], which creaks under your weight. There are several [steps] missing here. It's quite a [gap]: probably more than you could jump across. On the other side of the [gap], the [stairs] continue down. Climbing up the [stairs] returns to the landing.
Northwest Junction In this corner of the backyard you can make out the enormous hedge, which is part of the estate's hedge [maze]. The stone walkway splits in three [directions] here: north, along the dark and towering hedge; south, past the fragrant and inviting [garden]; and east, where the walkway cuts a straight and narrow path between the hedge and the [garden].
Front Porch You're standing on the front porch of the [house].
It isn't much to look at, but it's well-suited to this kind of thing. And by this kind of thing you mean the long, drawn-[out] political discussions you half-[heartedly] attend and the impromptu croonings of old union ballads. [Painted] a nauseatingly [pastel blue] that's [chipped] in [places], it's the all too neon exterior to a typical punk-[house], shared by six or seven misfits at any given time. A [screen door] leads east, while the big, wide world extends westward.
The major industries here were time tourism and the refining of [cows] into liquid leather, but the principality has since fallen upon hard times. Edessa is to the Northeast, and Jerusalem is to the South.
Jerusalem, Holiest of Cities! A bit seedy, really, but the [tourists] still come, and a combination of [Templars] and 22nd century [Russian mercenaries] keeps the city safe from both the Seljuks and the Caliphate of Cairo. For now, at least.
High up in Jotunheimen, on a path going west (where you came from) and east. To the north of you is your [cabin], to the south a long drop. Behind your [cabin] is a steep tall mountain [wall]. The door to your [cabin] is gone. [Bullet holes] show it has been shot away. It must have been done by humans; yeti robot zombies don't carry guns.
It looks like some very heavy fighting has taken place here; all the [furniture] has been [smashed] to bits. Your bedroom is west, the [outside] south.
All the [furniture] has been [smashed] here too, except for the [large closet]. It is open and empty. An extremely [dead soldier] lies all over the floor. A [cell phone] and a [plasma rifle] lie here. They are not yours. Maybe they belonged to the [soldier].
A [ruined temple of bread] stands on the metal plain, which stretches away in every (cardinal) direction.
The Street mills with people; at this time of day, it's the only place to be. Businessmen are walking back from lunch, street [vendors] are selling [jewelry] of dubious quality, and everywhere is the air of good cheer. That will, you are sure, end soon, unless you can placate the evil.
You survey your small [bedroom]. To be frank, it's messy. Your clothes hang in strange places. The carpet is stained with unidentifiable substances. The wallpaper is faded and tacky, the [bed] is falling apart, and the drywall is crumbly and, inexplicably, rusty, but it's home.
Rather surprisingly, your living room is relatively clean, leaving you to wonder why you have such a trashy bedroom. It's about as average a living room as you can find, except for the large [picture of Andy Warhol] you have hanging on the east wall. Your tiny kitchen is north, and your front door lies west.
Your small kitchen nook is less kitchen and more nook. It's essentially a reach-in closet masquerading as a kitchen. A [microwave] sits on the wall, just next to an old [refrigerator].
Your studio apartment is a little small, but the [ceiling] is nice and high, and you haven't that much to store, really, just a few [clothes], the [computer], the [bed] and the [rabbit hutch].
It's rather darker and closer than you like down here, but you've taken the [subways] before and can control your discomfort. Of course, the platform is crowded and all the humans are staring at you.
You trudge downtown a few streets. Passersby gawk and [cars] slow as their drivers crane their necks for a look at you. Not that they were going very quickly anyway in the morning [traffic].
The downtown [train] is jammed with [humans]. It's rush hour, after all.
Chaos has come to the [subway] car. Best to get out before you're crushed.
You are standing on a densely-settled residential [street] in front of a beige [house] with red trim. A short flight of [stairs] leads to the front door
The front [stoop] is a neat square of concrete with wrought iron railings on either side. The front [door] faces the [stairs]. On the brick wall next to the front [door] is a small black [mailbox]. A colorful rubber [mat] for wiping your feet on lies on the concrete
The immaculate fiberglass transom of your 45-foot [yacht] only highlights the hideous, scorbutic condition of your body. Fifty-eight days of nothing but carbohydrates, alcohol, and deep-fried poultry have come to this.
Squar griy [walls] envolop you. Work, wokr, work. Dedens the sol and nubs the mind. Where in this maz of expintial posibilties cold be the egres? A paradign of subtly taunts yout o find the BLUE RASPBREY!
This is your tiny, one-room studio apartment. Your [desk] is a mess of [papers], pizza boxes, and even a banana peel or two. Your bed lies in the corner. Well, okay, it's not really a bed. It's a mattress. Your kitchenette is absolutely filthy--you've been afraid to enter it for fear the cockroaches would eat you alive. The bathroom door is just to the north, while a door to the south leads outside.
You are on the cramped [command] deck of your scout ship. Electronic blinkies and [buttons] line the small [consoles], but truth be known, you don't really know what any of them do. The accessway to the rest of the ship lies [aft].
This [room] is the heart of the practical [astrology] project. For years scientists have understood how to foretell the future by observing the positions of heavenly bodies. Only in more recent times have they developed the technology to make good use of this by [moving] those heavenly bodies around to where they'll do the most good, using [devices] such as the [stellar shovotronic].
You are standing on the tip of a massive [iceberg] floating across the North [Atlantic]. It's dark and cold, and there does not appear to be a ship in sight for as far as your eyes can see. You could probably make your way down the side of the [iceberg], though.
This narrow [ledge] on the side of the [iceberg] feels terribly exposed. The side of the [iceberg] seems scarred, as if it had been hit by something of titanic proportions. You could probably climb up along the [abrasions] to the top of the [iceberg].
You are in the living-room of the Go's. The kitchen is through a door to the west, and [Gary's] room is to the north. A TV is mounted to the [wall] next to [Gary's] room to the north, and next to it is a [couch] and a [small table]. A large [dining table] with [chairs] is at the other end of the room.
The [hallway] comes to an end here, with a very fancy-looking [archway] leading [out] to the south. The rest of this godforsaken place lies beyond a [hallway] to the north.
You stand in a T-junction connecting [three] of this building's rooms.
This region appears to control something up [above]. You're not sure what that could be.
This area has been converted into an impromptu [bedroom].
This nondescript hallway connects [three] of the building's [four] rooms.
On a [sidewalk], in front of [Scott's house], a thick [fog] moves through the neighborhood like a misty white river. Your home is to the north.
On a [sidewalk], up the [street] from Scott's house, a thick [fog] moves through the neighborhood like a misty white river, and a faded [green station wagon] cruises nearby in the [street]. Home is north and Scott's house is back to the south.
You're standing at the end of a [driveway] with a light [green station wagon] blocking your way home. The [blonde-haired] [man] is here.
[Karl] is here.
You also see a [lion].
You also see a [lion], a [lioness], and four [lion cubs].
You're in the [street] parallel to the [sidewalk], lined with tightly [parked cars]. The [street] runs north-south and an intersection can be seen to the north. The [fog] billows nearby, a large shape passing through it.
You're standing at the end of a [driveway]. There is a faded [green station wagon] here.
No true [seaman] would call a nutshell like this a "[boat]", but it is large enough for four men, and at the moment the only thing that keeps you alive. Outside, there is [water] everywhere, as far as you can see. It is rather windy, and there are some medium-sized [waves] that play with the [boat] as if it were a toy.
Outside, there is [water] everywhere, as far as you can see, except for the [shape] of a small [island] to the north, half hidden in the [mist].
Water everywhere, as far as you can see, except for the [shape] of a small [island] to the north, half hidden in the [mist].
I spy with my little eye... A [bar stool].
You're inside a small and cosy pub. A sign painted over the [bar] reads:- 'The Nobody Inn'. Certainly, the place seems to be deserted and you can see no exits. The room is lit by a large [window] that is next to a closed [door].
The [balloonport] is in the tiny settlement of New Uppsala. Through the downpour, you can make [out] a cluster of [buildings] a [short] distance away. [Houses], at a guess, [but] in a bewildering assortment of [architectural] styles. In front of you a [small customs desk] separates an [official] from your [fellow passengers] as they see to [their luggage and papers].
"In ye go!" With a heave and shove, two burly guards in [matching] green tights toss you into [Orchestra] Pit. As the earthen sides rush past you and sunlight dims, you have the sinking sensation that perhaps "Ode to a Duck" was not the best choice from your repertoire...
The earthen [sides] of this [pit] look loose and near the consistency of [mud]. They seem to rush past as the speed of your descent increases.
The light from above dims with [each] passing moment. A large [gnarled root] from some hidden [root] system protrudes from the [side] of the [pit] here.
Although the [bottom] is quite dark, you think you are about halfway down the [pit]. The [end] of a [rope] is caught in the [muddy] [wall] here and the [length] of the [rope] hangs down about five feet.
You can just barely make out the [bottom] of the [pit], far below you. A small [outcropping of stone] juts from the [side] of the [pit] here.
You are almost at the [bottom] of the [pit]. Now that impact is so imminent, you almost wish you could keep on falling.
The [pit] is about twenty yards in diameter and [run-off] from the [sides] drains into a large [mud puddle] in the center of floor. Every step squelches like grapes under a cart wheel and the air is thick with the odour of [mud] and mildew.
You are standing in King's Street, [outside] the public entrance of "The National Board of Sustainable Development". The Board is located in a wealthy neighbourhood in the city centre. The street is lined with blocks of flats from the early twentieth century, mixed with governmental buildings and shops.
You live in a simple one-[room] flat in Suburbia.
The entrance [hall] is a small room without windows just inside the [door]. There's a reception desk there and a glass [door] leading to the north. To the east you can see a huge [notice board] and a [wastepaper] [basket]. Next to the north [door] is a [button].
The supermarket has an advantageous position next to the Board. The civil servants buy their [fast food], soft drinks and other eatables here.
Loose, muddy [soil] covers most of the [ground] and the air is heavy with the deep, fertile smell of freshly-turned [earth]. Nearby, a large [hole] gapes darkly, the depths of which are hidden in shadow.
An iron-wrought [gate] lies askew on [rusted] [hinges], no longer able to prevent external access to the [churchyard] during late hours. The [muddy path] leading past them and southwards into the church [grounds] is being churned by the heavy [rain], but not quite enough to completely obscure a [faint impression] therein.
There is just enough room in this tiny hut to sit and keep watch--were there still a chair upon which to sit. Presently, nothing remains but a cramped space to stand while one gains a moment's respite from the ceaseless downpour [outside].
The [gravel path] you are on passes by a plot of [manicured land] upon which resides a small [church building]. It is fashioned of [dark river stone, stained] all the [darker] [from] the downpour. Its [steeple] rises suddenly into the gloom, so that the [belfry] up top is partially obscured. Through the barred [windows] a glimmer of yellow light issues, flickering like [candlelight]. The front entrance is to the east, while the [path] continues south.
Here is where parishioners must have parked their vehicles, be they wagon or automobile, before proceeding north to the [church building]. A [gravel road] leads north past the front of the [church]. To the south, a [rain]-slicked [road] leads off into the [dark] distance. East of here is a wooden [coach house].
The coach house is quite old, and indeed once served to house a horse-driven coach. It has since been converted for use by automobiles. There are [shelves] lining the [walls] containing various [items] one would expect to find in a garage. Against the north wall is a [rubber tire]. Access to the driveway is to the west, through the main entrance, and a small exit leads east.
Running between the coach house and a [small shack] to the east, this [path] is lined on [both] sides by tall [brush and bracken], which block your view elsewhere.
A [small shack] rises [out] of the [overgrowth] in a [clearing] at the end of the winding [path]. It looks quite old, but has not fallen into disrepair, as has the coach house and the other [small] buildings on the church [grounds]. Along the front is a [wooden door], and a [small] square [window] to its right, which flickers with a pale yellow light issuing from within.
The [heavy oaken doors] of the [church] loom before you, presenting a sensation of disorientation that you did not experience [from] a distance. [Great brass handles] present you with a means of access to shelter [from] the torrential weather. There are curious [inscriptions and bas-relief] [carvings] worked into the wood.
This is a very [long room], lined with [multi-tiered] [bunks]. [Flimsy partitions] between the tiers may provide a modicum of privacy. These [spartan] living [quarters] could house hundreds, many of whom are sleeping here right now. There are [archways] on the north and east walls.
The bright [sunlight] hurts your eyes, causing you to squint for a moment or two before noticing your [surroundings]. You're standing [outside] on a large concrete [terrace], wedged in between a [mountain] to the north and an immense [black monolith] to the south. The [mountain] looks [foreboding and scary] but a [small white house], unassumingly nestled into the base directly to your north, looks inviting enough. The [small, meandering] [path] which once led up the side of the [mountain] to the northwest is now blocked by [brambles and thickets], making it impassable.
On the inside, the [phone booth] looks just as normal as it did on the outside. The only difference is that the [phone], instead of having a slot for coins, appears to have a [small hole] for cork nuts.
This room is brilliantly lit from all directions. In fact, it is unclear where the walls and ceiling end. A doorway leads to the west, and tunnels lead in most other directions, although all but one are [boarded] up. An archway stands at the south end of the hall.
Rough-[hewn tunnels] surroud you on all sides. It looks like more [digging] has been done here, although the original exit to the northeast is still visible. More recently, though, several of the [tunnels] appear to have caved in, and the ladder which once led up to the hole in the ceiling has disappeared.
This [tiny, barren room] once housed the intake for the MUD [incinerator]. Once garbage [incineration] was outlawed, though (when it was discovered that when you burn things underground, the [air] just fills with [soot]), it became just a place where people drop old stuff to be recycled.
The [once-proud] [lounge] has been gutted [right] down to the bare [stone walls]. All the exits have been bricked up, except for the one to the east, and a [hole] in the [ceiling] is all there is to show that an [elevator] once lead upwards. An [uncomfortable]-[looking steel chair] sits in the centre of the [room].
Pillows are strewn about this [lavish chamber]. [Incense and candles] burn in the four [corners] of the room, and two [pillars] rise near the center of the room. There is a small [sign] mounted on the left pillar. Scratched into one [wall] are the [words]: "THE END IS NIGH!"
You are standing in a wide open square in the better part of the [LonDome]. Bright sunlight shines through the [white, translucent] [skin] of the Dome high above. All around you, [people] bustle about on unknown errands, mostly avoiding the seedy-looking alley to the south. A small bookstall lies northeast, and stairs lead down to the subsurface shuttle terminal. The view, however, is dominated by the [imposing building] in the east, it's [marble facade] soaring up to the heights of the Dome.
The pleasant nature of the nearby piazza is quickly forgotten in this gloomy, [refuse]-strewn place. Buildings thrust upward on either side, creating a claustrophobic [passageway] running east. You catch a glimpse of [movement] from within one of the many [windows] set into the [high-rises].
The alleyway ends suddenly with a rough [wall] barring any further progress; there is no way to go except back the way you came.
Nothing very impressive, merely a little kiosk selling the usual top 10 [bestsellers] in [paperback], [newspapers], a couple of [childrens storybooks and comics], and the usual [furtive magazines]. Not the kind of place you walk into and ask to be directed to the Reference section.
The music is very loud and the place is crowded. In the middle is the [bar], surrounded by people asking for drinks. Near the [stairs] heading up to the exit are the [toilets] and the [lifts]. Standing close to the exit door is the bouncer.
The receptionist is still folding some linen in the [sofa]. Some people are there watching TV while others using the [computers]. To the west is the lift that leads to the guests' rooms.
The [elevator] has a [console] with many [buttons] and a small hole where guests are supposed to insert the [keycard].
You're in a typical classroom in the school which was built at the end of the Great Depression. [Green blackboards] have replaced the old black types and the [walls, desks and ceiling] (where a [sprinkler system] has been installed) have been repainted. The [door] leading [out] is west.
This plot of earth is where the [friars] grow their [herbs]. Back in town, it's whispered that they grow mandrake and nightshade and such vile things to use in sorcerous potions, but that's just talk. Some of the [herbs] are good to eat, and others make simples for the sick, and that's an end to it. A trail south leads back to town, and the [friars'] rooms are just inside the small stone house to north. [Friar Bungay] is here, patiently pounding a [stake] into the soil with a [sturdy mallet].
You are standing on a small [stool] in the kitchen. From here you can clearly see the [top] of the [refrigerator], but you can't reach it.
Except for your [car] and the dirty [snowdrifts] in the corners, this broad expanse of [pavement] is entirely empty. The wind whistles a little, and instinctively you hunch your shoulders and turn up your collar. The [dark bulk] of the [shopping center] squats in decaying splendor to the south, and a paved [walkway] leads in that direction.
The [heavy] structure of the [shopping center] stretches left and right from here. When you crane your neck the [building] seems almost to be leaning outward, as if it's in some danger of collapsing on top of you, or perhaps pouncing on you. Doubtless that's only a trick of the light. An [arched] [entryway] beckons to the south, above it the [inscription]
In spite of the [arched ceiling and gilt brickwork], this chilly and ill-lit passageway fails to cast an inviting spell. Rather, it gives an impression of inexpressible sorrow, if not outright squalor. Perhaps the odor of damp and decay is to blame. A [door] in the east wall is situated next to a display [window] that bears the legend "[SOMETHING WICKED]". The open [doorway] in the west wall, next to which is a small [placard] that says "[OFFICE]", seems more starkly businesslike. The passage is open to the north and south, and there is a deeply [shadowed recess] or [niche] in the northwest corner.
This cheerless, windowless, functional little room is lighted solely by a bank of 16 small [black]-and-white [television] [monitors] arranged in a 4x4 [matrix] on the north [wall], above a broad [desk]. Mounted on the [wall] beside the [doorway] in the east [wall] is a [gray metal box]. A stout, balding [security guard] dressed in a [gray uniform] is slumped sideways in a [chair], one [elbow] planted on the [desk], fast asleep. The [guard's] [chest] rises and falls in a slow rhythm, and he snores faintly through his [mustache].
You are standing in a shallow [recess] in the west wall of the chilly passage. From here, the main part of the passage lies to the east and southeast.
In better weather, this paved expanse might be a pleasant place to have a cappuccino or a frozen yogurt. The tables and chairs have all been taken indoors, however, leaving the [patio] frigid and uninviting. Over the [low hedge] to the north you can see your [car] in the parking lot. The Main Entrance is off to the east, and on the south is a [glass door] beneath a [sign] that reads "[BIG YUMMY SANDWICHES]". Set in the [pavement] near the [door] is a small [grate].
A high [hedge] borders this narrow [gravel] walkway on the north (to your left as you come down the walk from the Main Entrance), and the [blank brick wall] of the building is to the south. Toward the east end of the [path] is a stairway leading upward, and at the west end the main entrance of the shopping center can be glimpsed. Beyond the stairway is a round [tower] with a [conical roof].
This small, bare, deeply shadowed area beneath the outside stairway is wedged between the close-pressing [hedge] on the north and the walls of the building on the south and east. In the [cylindrical] [curve] of the east wall is set a [doorway], which is blocked by a [sheet of gray stone]. On the west, there is just room to squeeze between the [hedge] and the stairs.
A long, [roofed]-over promenade extends westward from here. To the northeast is a [doorway] leading into a squat and fussy-looking round [tower] with a [conical roof], and to the north is a stairway leading downward. A [doorway] to the south yawns wide open, and the [sign] above the [door], which reads "[TUNE TIME]", is hanging crooked. To the southwest is an open archway. Looking out to the north you can see over the top of the [hedge], beyond which your [car] is sitting by itself in the parking lot.
This north-south passageway is distinguished mainly by the [boarded-up] [doors and windows] in the east and west walls, and by the fact that a good deal of [trash] has blown in from somewhere and not been swept up.
This open passageway looks out over a [railing] to the center of the arcade below, where you can see a large [Christmas tree]. You can continue along the passage to the east or west, or pass through an open archway that leads north.
From this open passageway you can look over the [railing] to the central arcade below, or descend the stairs to the east. The [concourse] continues to the north and south. Above the [door] to the west is a [sign] that reads "IN THE [PINK]", and a [door] in the southwest corner bears the legend "[HERE'S LOOKING] AT YOU". There is also an unmarked and dismal-[looking] passage that leads northwest.
You are standing on the west side of the central arcade area. A gap in the [railing] affords access to the center of the arcade on the east, and the walk extends north from here. To the southeast is a broad stairway leading upward, and beside the stairway in the south wall is a [door] above which a [sign] in elaborate Olde Englishe letters reads "[INKWELL FINE PRINT]". In the west wall is a display [window], and next to it a [door] above which is a pink [sign] that reads "YOUR [GORGEOUS] SELF". A gray [door] on the northwest bears a small [sign] with the universal symbol for unisex lavatories.
The center of the arcade is open to the deep gray [sky], and surrounded on the east, north, and west by [railings]. In [each railing] is an opening through which you can pass. The south end of the arcade is occupied by a large [Christmas tree], and next to the [Christmas tree] is a [boxy object] that looks rather like a [fireplace].
This open passageway looks out on the center of the arcade to the north; the top of a [Christmas tree] pokes up past the [railing]. On the south wall is a large and rather cutesy [cartoon] [poster] of a prancing [reindeer]. There's a [door] in the southwest corner beneath a [sign] that reads "[HERE'S LOOKING] AT YOU", and another in the southeast corner next to a [sign] that declares it "THE [BOOT SECTOR]". You can also proceed east or west along the [concourse].
This is the [arena's] oval-shaped performance [ring] which is occupied by a sagging, rectangular safety [net].
You are standing, perched perilously high above the [arena] floor, a couple of baby steps across the [tightrope].
You are in the Computer Room where the main Excaliber server is kept. A large, long wooden table is cluttered with a [full]-size computer tower, Pioneer CD ROM changers, a 17 inch computer monitor and various other equipment. A doorway to the east leads to the main set of offices.
It is apparent that the occupants of this office think of work first and organization last. [Each of four] desks are cluttered with print-outs, computer equipment and telephones. These cramped offices are lined with filing cabinets in addition to the desks. Free space is definitely a commodity. The computer room lies to the west, the main exit is south.
This is the [hut] that you have lived in most of your long life. Here is the [large bed] which you once shared with your wife; further from the [door] is your [son's smaller bed]. Within reach of [both beds] is the [little table] you share with Rykhard.
Candles on the wood-[panelled [walls]] create a comfortably dark atmosphere. Hand-[drawn maps] are taped to nearly every surface -- the [walls], the [ceiling], the [trophy case] in the corner. [Seating] is plentiful. A [small storage closet] is to the north.
This treasure house has been thoroughly sacked -- by you, of course. Locked chests have been reduced to kindling, reliquaries to so much broken glass and leading. You are certain that you have found all that this secret trove has to offer. It's probably best not to hang around. The guards are sure to wake up eventually. The only egress is [out] to the west.
This [small] rectangular [hall] has been chiselled from the [rock] by humans and covered with [black marble]. [Two bronze doors] to the south hermetically close off the exit; in the north a narrow [cave] leads to the fiery lair of the dragon. The floor is littered with [blackened] [bones and skulls], throwing [flickering] [shadows] southwards.
The [cave] is low, and you have to stoop to walk through. The floor is covered by a [thick layer of ashes]. The [flames] that erupt from the many [cracks] in the [ground] of the [large hall] to the north have an almost blinding intensity, and the heat if nigh unendurable. You are sweating heavily. In the south lies the relative coolness of the [vestibule].
The [hall] is dozens of meters high and hundreds of meters wide and deep. The floor is covered with a thick layer of ash, except where [cracks and fissures] cleave the rock. Huge [flames] shoot upwards [out] of these [cracks]. The heat is almost unbearable.
The weak light of the moon, which enters the room through the window, envelops the [furniture] of the bedroom in a cloak of unworldly beauty. Only the soft breathing of your wife in the large bed breaches the silence. The door next to the [heavy] oaken wardrobe leads to the landing to the north. It is [ice] cold in the unheated room.
The [landing] is enveloped by uneven [darkness]. [Moonlight] enters through the open [door] to your [bedroom] in the south. A [red door] to the north leads to the [room] of your daughter [Maartje]. Next to the [stairs] down stands an elegant [cupboard, above] which hangs a large ornate [mirror] in a [gilded frame].
Without [Maartje's] radiant presence, her [room] seems dead and empty. It is a dreary sight: a [bed] in which nobody sleeps, a [dollhouse] with which nobody plays, a [desk] behind which nobody studies. The gay colours in which you painted her [ceiling and furniture] appear in the pale light of the [stars] as a pallet of greys. The [door] to the south leads back to the [landing].
To the north, the [red door] to [Maartje's] [room] is slightly ajar.
Your front [garden] too has been buried by a thick layer of snow, which hides all plants [from] view. Only a few bare [bushes] that crouch against the [garden fence] penetrate the white [blanket]. Behind you, the front door leads back into the house, while the road to the east winds through the village and the [forest] to the [baron's] castle. [From] his unreachable heights the moon looks reproachfully down on you. The tip of the church tower can be seen above the [houses] on the other side of the road.
But you firmly step onwards while you try to devise a plan for entering the baron's castle. Then, suddenly, the howling of wolves starts you out of your reflections. It is hard to judge, but you would be surprised if they are more than a kilometer away [from] you. And it is at least another ten kilometers eastward to the baron's castle.
Even on the sunniest days, this [coniferous] [forest] is dim and gloomy, and in the dead of this [winter] night it is pitch dark. A [path], hardly recognisable as such, leads from the village in the west to the castle in the east. The [howls] of a [pack of wolves] rise from nearby. In this season game is scarce, and the [wolves] are hungry, bold and dangerous even to men.
Here the [path] is narrow and winding, and hardly recognisable under the [snow]. [Moonlight] penetrates the dense foliage only sporadically. Eastwards lies the baron's castle; to the west, your own footprints lead back to the village.
Eastwards lies the stone house of the hunter; to the west, the tracks of your prey lead to were the [humans] live.
From this part of the winding [path], you can see the [stone house] of the evil human rising in the east. The silhouette with the three leaning [towers] is outlined against the [starry] [sky]. A [trail of paw prints]--yours--indicates the [path] to the west. It is silent here; even the howling of your pack has faded.
The [trees] whisper softly in the cool autumn breeze. You [stand] on the northern fringe of the [forest], beside the [muddy] [track] which shows the [fresh [tracks]] of the car that brought you, now vanished into the haze.
The [old wet trees] loom above the [trail] leading to the south. [Bracken and ferns] poke their heads up from beneath the [carpet of leaves].
The [stark dead trees] tower around you in a motionless eldritch dance.
This is the upstairs [lobby] of the RSP corporation. It's very different from the downstairs [lobby], in that it doesn't have a [nice reception desk, comfy chairs], or a [shiny chandelier]. It does have a [vending machine], though. There's a storage closet north of you and a shower room to the south. A really long hallway leads east, to freedom.
This room is for the convenience of the employees who work with sprockets and tend to end up covered in machine oil, or who work with rockets and end up covered in soot, or who work with pants. It has many [shower heads], for the purpose of [showering].
It is a [closet] which is used to store things. It is in fact, a small [storage closet], and from the perspective of the break room, it is to the north. A creative mind could possible even construe that vending machine as a trophy case. But it wasn't really intentional.
The [hallway] stretches on for a nigh-unimaginable distance to the east. Somewhere out there is the elevator which will take you downstairs so you can go find the object of your smoochie-filled desires.
Your [bedroom] is a nicely orchestrated mess. Clothes and furniture are strewn about in an almost artistic fashion. Salividor Dali would proud, if you had any idea who he was. Right next to the unmade [bed] is a [tiny, wooden dresser]. The only exit is to the south.
"The old, (once upon a time) sturdy wooden [bridge] had crossed the [Clearwater] River from east to west for as long as the prince could remember, and according to the stories, it had been there long before that, built when the kingdom was young. He fondly remembered hiding in the thick scrub below the [bridge] from his father's guards when he was but a boy. "
A [nice] mohagony table is in the middle of the kitchen. A blender is on the table. A [cabinet] is on the wall. A [fridge] is next to the [cabinet]. the library is west. a [closet] is east
there are many shelves with [books] in them. (look at them by entereing l [shelf]). You can only go east from here
Due to its versatility of design, this [corridor] can allow travel in either of two primary directions. There is the east, where you just came from, which leads back to the stage and other bustle. There is the west, which leads into darkness and mystery. And, if you prefer to stray from the path, Mr. Bishop's dressing room door is to the north.
Oddly, there's no one here. Just a [basket of mangoes wearing] a [tuxedo] with a [note attached] to it. A [basket of mangoes wearing] a [tuxedo] with a [note attached] to it? Oh no! Some evil villain has turn [Stephen Bishop] into a [basket of mangoes]! [Wearing] a [tuxedo]! With a [note attached] to it! You must find and apprehend this fiend! Oh, and don't forget to take Mr. [Bishop] with you. In case you can turn [him] back or something.
This [end] of the [corridor] is [shadowy and suspicious], filled with [suspicious] [shadows]. Mmhmm. The only obvious escape is to the east, back to the bright lights and smiling happy faces of all those people who were hoping to see Stephen Bishop. OK, maybe not so happy, once you have to explain that he's now a basket of mangoes.
This basement appears to have recently been transformed into a [laboratory], if the [huge mad scientist-esque machine] in the middle of the room is any indication. Alas, the hole in the [ceiling] that you fell through is well out of reach, and the only exit is a closed [door] to the east.
Your apartment. Much more relaxed now that your head feel cleared. It doesn't feel like the [walls] are attacking you anymore. It is pretty empty save your [computer]. You live frugally.

The [temple] consists of a [stone room] with an [altar] and a [statue] of you, sir. He entered it through an [archway] to the south.
You were there for hours, poring over massive volumes, until they sent you out and locked the door. You'd like to continue reading the book you checked out right away but you remember, now, that last night your last light bulb at your home blew, leaving you in the pitch dark. You know they sell light bulbs at the [convenience] store, [downtown]. If it's open, you'd also like to stop in at the pet shop--you've always felt a strong connection with animals of all kinds.
You are standing in front of a [large brick building]. The [sign] over the [door] reads, [STREGOICAVAR] [PVBLIC LIBRARY]. The [library] is at the north end of a short, dead end [street]. At the other end it meets a [street] running east and west. All around you are [dark, dilapidated] [buildings].
You can't help feeling that the [brick [buildings]] to the south are about to crumble. All the lower [windows] are [boarded] up and, of course, the [doors] are locked. You can see no way of gaining entrance, had you wanted to. A rickety [fire escape] terminates several feet [above] your head.
The [library] is to the north.
You are standing in front of a small, fragile looking [shack], sandwiched between [two large, empty, square buildings] with [FOR RENT signs] in the [windows of both] of them. The [shack] is your [home]. The [door] is directly to the north of you. The [street] comes from the west and does an S before turning to [dirt] and continuing east.
The [road] runs through [fields and trees]. It comes from the northwest and gradually turns south, where it narrows to a path upon entering a [forest] that stretches across the southern horizon. Some distance away, a [cliff] rises from the [trees] and the [forest] continues, at least [sixty] feet higher, on top.
This is [downtown Stregoicavar]; though, as far as commerce goes, it only consists of [three shops]. Also, sitting on a [hill] to the southwest, you can see a [bloated, meticulously] [maintained] [institutional] [building]: the [police station]. To the east you can see the [library roof] rising majestic [above] the [tattered shells] that surround it: an ancient reminder [both of Stregoicavar's] age and that it has certainly seen more prosperous times. Across the [street] is a [gas station]/[convenience] [store]. Beyond that is the [forest] that [covers] all the land south of [town]. On this side of the [street] are the [two] other [shops], to the northeast and northwest.
Inside the [coffee shop] there is a [counter], a [glass cabinet], a single [table] with a single [chair], a [clerk] behind the [counter], and a [blackboard] on the [wall]. [Everything] is well lit and clean. The [door] to the street is to the southwest. You are surprised the [shop] is [open] at this time of day.
You've come to an [entrance] within [CogCo] Industries, Incorporated's newest virtual property. An [archway] is to your north with a [sign] above the [entrance]. On the left side of the [archway] is attached a [small, silver bell]. Several [clamps] are placed in succession going up directly above the [bell] along the [wall]. Above the [clamps], up by the top of the [archway], is a [small wooden cylinder] with a [hinged] [door] on the bottom with a [small clasp] on one side.
A [metallic voice] buzzes [out]: "Please, come into the [passage]."
No windows, no doors, no objects on the floor, nor on the [ceiling]; no [exits]. The [walls] are [bare]. There's only an open [passage] in the northern wall, from which I can hear [voices]. A [metallic voice] buzzes [out]: "You're not allowed to do anything here. Please come in."
A [metallic voice] buzzes [out]: "Sorry, Visitors can't do anything in the waiting [room]."
The first thing I see in this [long chamber] is the endless lightplay between thousands of [glass] panels scattered everywhere. I continue to look around and I see that the east and west [walls] are [two long reliquaries], made from thousands of little [glass cells].
Dock and [wild flowers] adorn the [sweeping hedgerows] that surround this large expanse of [grass and clover]. The bright, open nature of this gleaming [meadow] makes it a perfect meeting place for [Bethsaida's] many [townspeople]. To the northwest, the [waters] of a large [lake] lap gently against its [shore] and in the [valley] to the east lies a bustling [town] centre.
A [crowded] [town] centre, [bustling people] go in and [out] of the plethora of [premises] that line all sides of the square. Made of a [light [sandstone]], these [buildings] seem to just melt away into the surrounding [desert]. To the south is the daily [market] of the [town] and on the [mound] to the west lies the [town's] meeting place.
The [marketplace], the busiest area of the [town, throngs] with [people] passing news, buying [handbags] and gossiping about the latest charioteer champions. The [town] centre sprawls northwards.
A grand and majestic building, the synagogue stands tall at the top of the [city]. Inside are row upon row of pews to sit on, as well as the high [altar], this month adorned with deep-green hangings. The hushed silence of prayer is somewhat overwhelming. Southwest, through the great oak door, lies the town, in all of its dusty, sprawling glory.
The [Sea of Galilee] lies before you - the enormous [freshwater] [lake] famous for its fishing trade. Its [shores] are among your favourite places to teach. You invariably attract crowds of hundreds of people from the plethora of villages that surround the [Sea], all as thirsty for the bounty offered by the [lake] as they are for spiritual guidance.
The [Sea of Galilee] stretches [out] to the horizon, its [water] glistening in the last [rays] of the day's [sunlight]. The [boats of fishermen] cruise southeast.
This is the midpoint of the [boardwalk], which continues to the north and south. At the northern end you can make out a parking lot and a clump of snack shacks. The southern end fades into the commercial district. To the east, over the [rail] of the [boardwalk], is a quiet residential street, and to the west, over the other [rail], is the [beach], and, beyond that, the big mama.
Distant [flashes of light] tumble through the unending [dark mist].
Distant [flashes of light] tumble through the unending [dark mist], and the roots of the World Tree are just barely visible above.
The master [bedroom] containing a [bed, wardrobe, bedside] [cabinets], [cupboards and sundry] other [items]. There is a [large window] on the north [wall].
The [landing] off which are 2 bedrooms, a small office, bathroom and toilet. Stairs lead down to the hallway near which is a [window]. A small [wooden blanket chest] stands against one [wall].
A small [bathroom] containing the usual [bathroom] accoutrements, notably a [bath, washhand basin and towel rail and towels].
This is Joe's [bedroom], a complete [mess] in which, barely discernable is a [bed, wardrobe] and some [cupboards]. The [junk] on the floor consists of many different toys and books. There is a [window] on the south [wall].
Stairs leading from the ground to first floor. There is a [painting] on the [wall].
A small [hallway] leading to the kitchen, lobby and livingroom. There are some [pictures] on the [wall].
A large [lounge] containing a TV, [videocassette] [player, settee], [chairs], small [table] with [drawers] and a [vivarium]. There is a [window] and doors lead to the diningroom and back to the hallway.
A small [kitchen] containing a cooker, [sink, cupboards], [worksurface], [freezer and fridge]. Doors lead to the hallway, pantry, passage and dining room.
A [small lobby], you can enter the front garden from here or return to the hallway. There are some [coathangers] here.
A dining room, in which you can see a large [wooden] [table], four [chairs], a [welsh dresser, bookcase] and a [picture].
This room is supposed to be the [laundry] room. If not for the word of your RA you would easily have believed that this was the junkyard. The hallway is to the east.
This is one of the small dark hallways of blair. It leads off to the south. To the west you can make out the [laundry] room.
This is more of [Blair's] dungeon like hallway. It continues off to the north and south. You see the bathroom off to the east.
Sure, you're used to piece-of-shit architecture (you live in Dundalk, for crissake), but this place will be receiving some kind of award from you by the end of the night. There's totally unimportant crap strewn all over the place -- old [sewing machines], an Easy-[Bake oven], even a set of [folding chairs] painted [carnival blue] -- but fortunately, almost all of it is in shadow thanks to an underperforming [fifty-watt] [bulb] directly above.
This is your scratching [ground], your own [little] slice of the shit pie these sons of bitches call an office -- and don't think for a second that you didn't have to fight like hell to get it. Neatly shoved away into the southwest corner of the general [work] area, where they think you can't get into any mischief.
You wake up with splitting pain in your forehead. There is a small [bump] on your head where you hit the shelf. It is very dark. You try to move around but immediately hear the rattling metallic sound. A [chain] shackles your leg. Oh, dear. The air is warm and stale and you cannot feel any draft coming in. The darkness is a slight shade of red. There is noise in the room. Steam, you think. You believe you can notice a [rectangular] [strip] of very weak [light] above.
This is the grand entrance to the studio lot. For almost a hundred years the famous [arches] to the south have been the portal beneath which Hollywood's greatest stars have passed on their way to silver screen immortality. A pleasant walkway heads west, while the studio's main administration building can be seen off to the northeast.
The studio has done a lovely job landscaping this area of the lot. A [walkway], flanked by a flower border, continues east and west, adjacent to the main drive, which bends north here into a large parking lot. The base of studio's large water [tower] can be seen to the northwest.
You are on [Washington] [avenue] in front of your [hotel], the [Inn] of the [Anasazi]. Although you don't recall seeing any [Anasazi], you are taken aback by the beatiful [wood facade] of the [Inn]. It has a distinctive Pueblo Indian/Spanish look that is unique to Santa Fe. Massive [vigas] that support the second and third floors protrude from the building and rest on the supporting [beams].
Spanish soldiers housed in the [presidio] to the northwest that is now the [Palace] of the Governers once marched on this historic square. It has been the social center of the city since 1610.
[Pigeons and people] flock on the [plaza]; the [pigeons] search for food and the [people] for art. Down West [Palace] Avenue you can see the Museum of Fine Arts, and to the north is the [Palace] of the Governors.
You are standing under the [portal] of the [Palace] of the Governors. This used to be the seat of the Spanish government in what is now the [American] Southwest, and is the country's oldest public [building].
This is probably the busiest corner of the [plaza]. It marks the end of the old Santa Fe Trail, which came all the way from Missouri. A [stone marker] stands near the sidewalk crossing the [plaza] to the northwest. The historic hotel, La [Fonda], stands to the southeast.
Shops and [galleries] line the [plaza], and except for the [tourist] clothing you feel like you're in an old Mexican town.
The [building] to the north is a smooth [adobe building] that seems to rise and fall like a high desert landscape. The west end of the [building], where the [auditorium] is, looks very much like an old Spanish fort.
This park lies on [Cathedral] place which runs northwest and souheast. The St. [Francis cathedral], with its authoritive presence and romantic architecture stands against the deep blue sky.
The Santa Fe Trail here continues south, near the [Loretto Chapel] along the street named after it: "Old Santa Fe Trail." An interesting-looking [chapel] stands on the southeast corner of this intersection.
The [train] is crowded as usual this time of the day, with no [seats] available. You sometimes occupy [yourself] by reading the [ads] above the [windows], but most of the time you just stare [out] the [windows] as you wait patiently for your stop when you can push your way through the nearest [exit].
This is the main [work] area of [Bob's Garage]. [Two] of the [walls] are lined with [shelves] containing [car parts], and one [wall] is lined with [cabinets] full of [tools]. Over the [tools] is a [clock] telling you just how late it currently is. Unfortunately, the [lift] you usually use to raise [cars] when [working] under them is broken. Of course, the west [wall] has the [garage door] through which [cars] enter and leave. At the southern end of the room is [Bob's office], but he doesn't like you going in there when he's not around.
Bob has a small and cramped office - mainly a private place for [him] to work on the [desk] wedged into the corner next to the [filing cabinet]. The only pleasant thing about the office is the coolness provided by the [air conditioner] on warm summer days. Otherwise, the cramped stuffiness makes you long to go back [out] to the [garage] you see to the north.
You are standing in the back lot behind the backyard of the house--your house--to the east. There's lots of junk here that your [father] has accumulated over the years, which reminds of what the inside of your locker looks like at school.
You are standing in your backyard. [Mother's] well-tended garden sits in the corner that you dutifully avoid trampling through, at least when she's looking. Oh, the hours you spend in the classroom, dreaming up schemes to destroy her flowers while leaving you with a perfect alibi. You can enter the [house] to the east or go around it to the northeast or southeast.
This is the front porch of your [house]. Maybe someday you'll be able to finally say more than three words to Melanie and she'll come by and visit and you can sit on the rocker out here and do whatever exactly it is that kids do in that sort of situation. You can enter the [house] to the west, or go out to the street to the east.
You are staring at the dingy ceiling of a [recovery] room in a clinic. The image swims a little above you, sometimes detailed and sharp, sometimes fuzzy, as your head clears. The [fluorescent] [light] on the ceiling above you is slightly [dimmed], giving the whole room an almost-orange cast. You can't see much more without getting up from the cold [cot] underneath you. But you can smell unpleasant, antiseptic chemicals.
Your office, where you carry out your Bastardly duties, is equipped with the finest furnishings and equipment necessary to perform your work. As you have an aversion to cheap kit, your [desk] is the finest example of office [furniture] ever bestowed upon the human race. Sitting atop this monument to [furniture] is the single most [powerful computer] in the company; your personal [workstation]. Only two decorations adorn the [walls]; a [Bill Gatus of Borg poster] and a daily [calendar]. North leads out of Mission Control to other, less important areas while you spot a very large and serious looking door down the hall just east.
Stephen is standing in the midst of the [cubicles] looking confused and stressed. In other words, normal.
This medium-sized room looks very much like the IT department except there are just four [cubicles] which are home to the technical support staff. The combination of no ventilation, strong body odor, poor shelving and gross incompetence leaves a heady, almost metallic taste on your tongue. This area opens up to a larger room just west while a storage room is south.
This non-descript store room is used mostly as an adhoc changing room for employees that want to don "civilian [clothes]" when not in the office. A number of [suits] - all in as-new condition - line the [walls].
This large covered area allowed sunlight to splash in from six floors above you. All around you is [plantlife] surrounding a beautiful [fountain]. The chief function of all this scenery is to distract you from the fact that you work in a concrete shell surrounded by people with disgusting personal problems who resent you. Large [marble steps] lead down to the lobby.
The prevailing philosophy of your [boss] ("Play it safe.") extended to the heavy management decision of how to decorate his office; there is absolutely no distinction or personality here. A [bookcase] occupies one [wall] stocked with nothing but a couple of corporate [manuals] and an endless number of "For [Dummies]" [books]. Another [wall] is home to an alcohol-stained [filing cabinet]. A simple [cherrywood] [desk] is here with the [boss's] [laptop] sitting on top.
A tiny, cramped living space. Your bed takes up about half of it, your [wheelchair] half of the rest, and a small [bed-side table] half of the rest of that. There is a [mirror] on the [wall], and the [door] is to the north.
You are standing in the middle of a pretty town square in the center of a nondescript New England town. Like most any other nondescript New England towns, there's not much to see or do here, [but] maybe you'll find something [amusing] and enjoyable to do.
This room is full of skulls and bones. Right before you lies the slain [corpse] of the famous adventurer Monathan Mlask, who has met his doom here. A [door] leads, hm, let's say southeast.
Ted's old [office] is a windowless cell, with cinderblock walls that remind you of your first dorm room. Fluorescent lights glare down on you from the ceiling, warehouse style, [bothering] your eyes. The room is in chaos--you hardly know what to look at first. His [desk and chair] are pushed up against a corner, and the walls are lined with [shelves], posters, art and trinkets.
You are in a sparse, small room with no decoration whatsoever. It stinks of [garbage], metal and oil. From here, you can go north into the main museum hall, west into a nasty little break room, and east down a smelly hallway.
This is a break room, you guess? It lacks a kitchenette of any kind, with no counters, no sinks and no cupboards. The large [refrigerator] in the corner looks lonely, its surface bare of adornment. With a complete lack of tables or chairs, it seems less and less credible that any people work here.
Of all of the halls, this is the grandest. It even has a [sweeping staircase] going up to a balcony type thing that overlooks where you're standing. This room was created exclusively to house the [magnificent] [braintree], which is in the center of the room. The maintenance room where you woke up is to the south, and an [unobtrusive] [door] with an excessively obtrusive [padlock] on it is to the east.
This balcony looks [out] over the [magnificent] [braintree's] gently-[furred canopy]. There's an [exhibit shelf] here labeled "The Hundred-Year-Old [Typewriter]". A [sweeping staircase] leads back down to the Great Hall.
There is nothing special about this corridor, except for the [fire door] and the [control panel] beside it.
You are sitting on top of the exquisitely carved wooden dresser that houses Prince Charles' clothes, the remainder of his ill-named [toys] close by. Far away is the little pest's bed, but the only way to get there is by a long drop down, which your [plastic] body could hardly countenance.
You've tracked your [quarry] to this [small clearing] in the [woods]. Before you to the east is the [hastily-constructed] [shack] where you suspect they've hidden themselves. There is also, as always, a [mailbox].
This is a very [long road]. [Houses] are on either side. They're standing still, while the [road] runs north and south. Just to the south is your [home]. In the distance to the north is the [television] [studio].
This is still a very [long road]. [Houses], despite not moving, have apparently followed you. A ways to the south is your [home]. A ways to the north is the [studio]. A ways to the east is someone's backyard, but you'd have to climb over their fence to get there, and I didn't implement a fence.
Yes, it's still a [long road], but you're almost here! Well, you are here, but here is not where you want to be. You are almost there! The [television] [studio] is just to the north. Your [house] would be visible in the distance behind you if you turned around, but don't turn around! That's the wrong way!
Even in your short absence, the castle has come to look strange to you again. The towers are so high that the tops are lost in [cloud], and looking east or west, you cannot see the furthest extent of the [walls].
Open to a [grey sky], from which a [light] rain falls. You have never seen the courtyard otherwise: it [rains] in every season, winter or summer, no matter what lies beyond the moat.
Many [books] of precedent line these [walls], containing every kind of [contract] that can be made to bind every kind of soul.
Built for the bureaucratic offices of the palace. Inlaid in the floor is the [map] of all the lands that once this palace commanded.
The [stairs] rise from here towards the upper rooms, and open [out] onto the bare courtyard.
You do not often come this way, into the older part of the castle, which is narrow and has a low roof. The [walls], and the ceiling too, are deep scarlet, the color of the old king and queen that ruled here two hundred fifty years ago, when there was still a kingdom.
Locked in an [iron cage] are the house [treasures] -- He showed them to you one rainy day, telling you their many histories.
A little hexagonal room, from which you can see the [moat], the [lawn], and the beginning of the [forest outside]. The [windows] are [narrow], not much more than arrow-slits.
Here on the north [wall] and the south are [portraits] of historical events from times past: the assassination of [King Elzibad] in 1248; the [arrival of Princess Lucrezia] from the Italian State of Medici-Credenza in 1545.
Less couth and cultivated than any other part of the castle, and you have been forbidden to visit this place before now. The [walls] press close to you on either side and the floor slopes down. Bears with sharp claws are carved into the rock, but they remind you of [Him], and you are not frightened.
There are never enough [tables] for a yard sale. The [people] who live here clearly have set [out] every table they own on the [driveway] in front of their [house]. It's a mismatched array of [card tables], a kitchen table, and a [scarred white desk], all piled with miscellaneous [junk].
This vast [hall] is obviously intended to impress visitors. A large [grandfather] [clock] stands on one side with an impressive flight of [stairs] on the other. A long [dirty coat] is hanging on a [hook] by the front [door]. Rooms lead off to the east and the south. The front [door] is to the north.
The deep pile [carpet] feels springy under your feet. There's a luxurious [three piece suite] positioned around a large [coffee table] in front of a large [fireplace]. The [patio doors] in the east [wall] gives the lounge a bright airy feel. The hall is to the west.
You're on a landing. There is a bedroom to the west, a study to the east and a bathroom to the south. A flight of [stairs] lead down to the hall where you can see an item of junk mail, a dirty overcoat, an answering machine, the grandfather clock and the open front door.
You're in the [bedroom] dominated by an impressive [four poster bed]. You can't think of a nice way to describe the fussy [floral [wallpaper]] that smothers the [walls]. The landing lies to the east.
The [bathroom] has all the facilities you'd expect including a [toilet], a [sink] and a [bath], except this one has marble and chrome everywhere proving yet again that taste and wealth are mutually exclusive. The landing is to the north.
You're in the study with a [bookshelf] taking up much of the north [wall]. An expensive [writing desk] takes pride of place in the study, positioned as it is, under the [window] and within easy reach of the [bookshelf]. The landing is to the west.
You're in the trailer of the Sacrosanct's truck of fiction, a gas-guzzling dogma house of the revolution. The [walls] are covered in [books], although quite a few have fallen to the floor.
Your [bedroom] isn't much to speak of - drab beige [walls] are largely hidden by a mess of random posters and furniture, and the furniture itself is hidden with a thick layer of general messiness. You're surprised to look around and not see any smoke in the air, because your olfactory bits are overwhelmed by the smell of burnt toast. It seems to be coming from the kitchen downstairs.
The [kitchen] is a bit more pleasing to the eye than your bedroom. The usual assortment of appliances and [kitchen] implements are here, aside from a microwave - you've really been wanting a microwave lately. You are still overwhelmed by this burnt toast smell, but can't see any smoke. The front door of your tiny abode is to the south.
You are in the quadrangle of a nondescript New England college, surrounded on all sides by buildings of higher education, all alike. Some [students] pass by on their way to class. Others look at their books, pretending to study.
You are in your [dorm] room, in Linnell House. It is bigger than a breadbox, but not by much. The door is to the north.
The diligently landscaped area outside of your [dorm] contains a few anorexic [shrubs] and some wild [crabgrass]. To the south is the red brick hell you call home. A muddy path leads north.
Your [apartment] is minimalist - just a desk, a chair and your mail-order course handbook awaiting you. The kitchen and and bedroom are around the corner (though you really don't have time to snack or take a nap right now). The front door is to the west.
It's a fine evening [outside]. Your antique car awaits to the north, and come to think of it you're due at the filming of Antique Roadshow in less than an hour. You really should get going soon.
The [chalice] is the pride of the Museum's collection, and this room -- "[vault]" is a more appropriate term, really -- is evidence of that. There is only one exit, to the south, which is sternly watched during operating hours and solidly locked at all other times. This is an "other time," and the heavy metallic [door] looks quite firm.
An airy, open space, with [walls] of alternating courses of green and white Florentine marble. Up above is the [skylight] you rappelled in through.
Icons line the [wall] in a dizzying profusion of symbolism and gilt. There are exhibit rooms to the east and west of here.
This room is a continuation of the [Architecture] room to the north, and leads into the Musical Instruments exhibit to the west. The [walls] here are fairly barren, but the floor more than makes up for it.
Cases of [manuscripts] line the [wall] at about chest height. The exhibit continues to the east, from the north.
The exhibit continues from the east, past rows upon rows of eerily silent [instruments] in glass [cases] in this room, to the south. There is also a [door] to a small restroom to the north.
You stand in line at the consumer electronics retail counter. The Commodore 32 with a series of first generation [games] has now launched and is ready for sale. You've already bought your C32 system and now need software. There are six 32K Z-Cart [games] available for the system at this time.
The stench of offal hangs in the air.The [walls] drip with fresh [blood]. An [ugly table] supports [plates] and a massive assortment of [cutlery]. This is not an environment that encourages rational thought. Empty doorframes lead north, east, south and west.
You stand upon a small stone [patio], surrounded by [plants]. Ripe [fruit] dip from [vines], tempting you with their colours. An [ornamental] [fountain] gurgles to your left. Daylight peeks through the heavy layer of greenery above. A dense perfume almost overwhelms you. You can go deeper, to the north. The kitchen is to the south. Stone [walls] bar all other directions.
There is nothing but [plant]-life. You are having some difficulty in moving around. A pair of tiny reptilian [eyes] stare at you from the depths of the brush.
A [man] glares at you from a [pedestal] against the north [wall]. His body is wood, his face is formed from paint. You feel guilty. A [flaming bowl] sits in front of the [pedestal]. A doorframe leads east.
A [fine wooden desk] stands in front of you. A [chair], placed before it, seems to beckon. The surroundings are decorated, carpet and wallpaper hiding the plain floor and [walls]. One of the [walls] has a [framed picture] attached to it. A [fine wooden door] stands to the east, a [dark wooden door] to the north, a [pale wooden door] to the south, and an empty frame to the west.
A large [screen television], the largest you've ever seen, dominates the room. Colourful images try to steal your attention, and high-quality sound fills the air. There is a VERY comfortable looking [armchair] waiting. The [pale wooden door] stands to the north.
Shelves surround you, filled with [books] of the greatest importance (you assume). Your feet sink into the thick [carpet]. A [table and chair] await you in the middle of the room. The [fine wooden door] leads west.
You amuse yourself to think of this as your living [room]. Technically, if you have to demarcate it from the rest of your apartment, it is that-which-is-not-the-[bathroom]-or-[kitchen].
Sonny [Rae] is sitting at the [table], watching you.
You are standing at the top of a [lighthouse], with [glass] panels all around the circular room. It is pitch black [outside] and rain pounds the [glass]. The occasional lightning strike lights up the night [sky] giving you a brief glimpse of a lifeless horizon and a dark, empty [sea]. Steps lead downwards into the [lighthouse].
This appears to be the living quarters of the lighthouse. Compact and cosy, it contains [everything] you would need to live here including a [stove], comfortable [furniture] and a [large rug]. A [cupboard] takes up most of the far wall and a [dining table] stands close by. [Everything] is covered in [dust], untouched for months or even years.
Bottom of the lighthouse, with a large [iron door] leading [outside]. There is nothing else of note, other than a small mouse [hole] opposite the [door].
You appear to be floating in some [oily] black [liquid]. The [ceiling] is close overhead, as the tank is rather full. There is a platform to your south.
The platform is very small, and is only used in the event of problems with the [oil]. It seems very unused. A round door to the south leads out of the tank.
Not quite what you expected on a ship this size. There are exactly three [bunks], one for the [captain], one for the [first mate], and one for the [second mate]. It seems [everything] else is automated.
This is the main hall of [Matt's] clubhouse. It has wooden paneling, and it's [big] enough to make [everything] you mutter to [yourself] echo. Some [streamers] hang from the ceiling, and a few [banners] are hung across the walls. A couple of [folding tables] have been set [out]. Over to the west you can see the [door] leading to the [bathrooms], and to the south is the [big door] that leads to the hallway connecting most of the other rooms.
A hallway connecting most of the rooms in the clubhouse. It has a few [banners] hanging on it's plain white walls, and (especially compared to the main hall) it's very cramped. To the north is the [door] leading to the main hall, to the west is a [green door] leading to a small room filled with books and other things for people to mess around with when the party becomes to droll, and to the south is a slightly larger part of the hall that leads [outside], and is used for hanging up coats.
A drab, gray looking room. Alongside the west wall is a [bookcase], filled with boring looking books that are written on seemingly any subject, as long as it's not interesting. There's a [decorative] [lamp] on a [small table] in a corner, near a [plush armchair]. The other side of the room has one of those [foosball] things. To the east, there's a [green door] leading to the hallway.
This [bathroom] must be the most putrid thing you've ever smelled. There are some [urinals] along one wall, some [sinks] along the other, a funky looking [hand dryer] near the [door] leading [out], and some [stalls] near the back.
A small, plainly decorated room. It has a coat rack in the corner. During the party, there will probably be somebody stationed here to greet the guests. To the north is the hallway, to the west is a [black door] leading to the dining hall, and to the east is a [white door] leading [outside].
Another giant hall, only this one is for eating in. It has plush, red carpeting and white walls. The Christmas banners haven't made their advance on this room yet, but it's probably only a matter of time. [Tables and chairs] are stacked along one wall. To the east is the [black door] leading to the coat room. To the west is [metal door] leading to the kitchen.
A small kitchen, with kitcheny things. Along the wall is a [counter], attached to which is an [oven]. There's a [refrigerator] on the other side. To the east is the [metal door] leading to the dining hall.
Laughter, [colors], the [smell of popcorn], and a [cool breeze]. The [carnival] surrounds you to all sides. There are [booths] all around you, where you can win giant stuffed animals for only a one [dollar] investment. [Signs] point this way and that, leading you to the [strongest man] in the world or the [bearded lady]. You [nose] tells you that the [food vendors] can't be far away. The [crowds] push in from all sides, but you can try to push past them in any directions.
[People] surround you on all sides, and you're not sure which direction is which. You're not really worried though: everybody around you seems to be having fun, and you didn't have any pressing engagements.
There's set of colored [targets] here, behind a long [counter]. There's no one here to take your money, but there is a [big sign] on the [counter]. Next to the [targets] is a [pile of cute stuffed animals].
You are standing in the middle of a bare room. There is a steel [door] to the west and another room to the east. There is a switch on the wall.
The room has faint wine odor. Although not quite bare, it still has relatively few noteworthy. A machine is stuck in the corner and a [big] wooden [drum] is at the end of the room. Judging by the [dust], this room hasn't been used in a long, long time.
This is the [street outside] the Badger Studios [offices]. The [street] extends east and west, but nothing of interest lies there: your path to stardom is through the shiny [doors] to the north.
This is the [reception] area of the [Badger] Studio offices. The [badger emblem] is set into the floor, and hangs [above] the [reception desk]. There are [sofas] set against the walls. To the north is a [lift], and to the south is the exit. There is a [doorway] to the east.
The women's toilets are white, well-lit and spotlessly clean. [Sinks] line one wall, behind which is a [mirror]. There are [two cubicles].
A moderately large open space with some [tables] and a [counter], on which are various [foodstuffs]. The way [out] is west.
You are in a [forest]. There is a [moat] to the north-east full of [crocodiles]. On the far side of the [moat] stands the [castle].
You are in a [forest], with a wide fast-flowing [stream] to the north. The [stream] flows into a [moat] to the east full of [crocodiles].
Wild [forestland] surrounds a quaint and [shadowed] [village].
The room is small and richly [carpeted]. Or maybe it's a tent. There's a hint of [curtains] or [tapestries] in the [darkness] beyond the little pool of light in the centre.
I sit on the hill, which overlooks the [stadium] of Pencey Prep. The current [game] is the annual end [game] with Saxon Hill. A very big deal. The [weather] is pretty cold. Beneath me are the foothills.
After numerous adventures you have [penetrated] the very centre of the Temple, to this tiny little vault where the cursed dessert lies. The room is small and unordained, unlike the rest of the temple, with just crumbly yellow bricks forming the [walls] and concrete making up the floor and [ceiling].
Bouncing along in a 4x4, the harsh bite of [Chen's] [cigarette] burns in your lungs as his smoking fills the [jeep].
There's dick-all to see here, even with the [goggles] on. [Armory [cabinets]], [supply shelves], two [brushed-steel benches, safety] [straps]. The [emergency station] is a [swivel chair] three [steps] up a [ladder], facing a [panel] with rugged [switches and levers].
You're in mid-[air], falling fast. You can't see the ground, and there's nothing to see in the sky.
You still can't see anything with your [faceplate] covered with slime.
First base. It's where [everything] starts, isn't it? Well, in this case, it really started on the pitcher's mound, but there was nothing exciting there, so maybe you'll have better luck here.
[Sweetness] fills the shade of the [High Wall] to your east. Under this [sweetness] lies a [small] expanse of [fod]. A [mobile] releases mildly to the west; far in that direction a [tower] proudly plants itself, while the [ground] rises more slowly to the south and relaxes to the north.
The [wall] to your east continues to gain out of sight. To your north is a massive transparent [cube], perhaps five of your heights on [each] side. Retreats lie west and south.
By the mobile south, a rounded [hole], five times as wide as you are tall, deepens through the [earth]. Its dark is deeper than that around you. The east is also passable.
The land increases towards your head to the south, and decreases away from your feet to the north. Mobiles lead accordingly in [both] directions. The [High Wall] may also be approached to the east. A long walk to the west is a [tower], dwarfing your form, and dwarfed in turn by the [wall].
Dun tumbles down loosely from a steep [hill] to the south, sliced through by the [wall] to the east.
The mobile from the north ends as the land's slope increases too greatly. [Dirt] glistens [blue]. To the south, amid the land, a way opens into darkness, while more [ground] lies to the east.
A [stone tower] rises [high] and west above you, surrounded by a ring of stamped [dirt]. An archway faces the [wall], strangely [small] compared to the [tower's] bulk; one must almost duck to transcend it. A [plaque] is set above the archway, approaching its size.
The inside of the [tower] is completely void, nothing remaining but a long spiral [staircase] rising through the [ceiling] far above. The plain awaits to the east.
When viewed, as now, from four stories above the [ground] and an equal distance from the top of the [tower], these [stairs] are the whole of the universe. Far above, they penetrate an opening in the [stone ceiling].
You stand in the middle of the desert on a [sand] deposit so large there is no dune in sight. Only the bright whitish [sun] hangs as the center piece to a boring portrait; A portrait you are not so sure if you are a part of. The [sky] glows a solemn blue turning into nothing but a haze as the horizon meets the burnt [sand].
You almost walk yourself right off the edge of the cliff before embracing a rock to hold you back. It's as if this cliff divides what is real and what isn't. From a certain angle you wouldn't even know it is there. You can't make [out] what is [below] except for a haziness drenched in mystery.
You find yourself on the inside of a white coffee mug. If it wasn't for the faint breeze of a diner fan [above] you it would be hard to tell where you were. It is a good thing the contents of this [cup] have been drunk already although you can still make [out] the scent of a freshly poured [cup] of Joe. An enormous [spoon], by comparison to your newly found size, rests against the rim and extends down to the bottom of the [cup].
All lights in the diner seem extraordinarily dim. The [jukebox] in the corner glows yellow and red and purple casting its colors onto the [table and pictures] on the walls. Only [barstools] and a [bar] stand in this diner. It is a cramped little place not unlike a sort of hopeless retreat for the sinners and loners.
An [old woman] on the side of the street beckons you to hear her plead for forgiveness. Her gaze does not lie on you however, but rather at the cobblestone [below], still damp and reflecting the faint yellow glow from the [streetlight]. You stand at the corner of a [boutique] and butcher's [shop]. [Tenements] covered in grime and accessed through bolted doors prove this street's vacancy.
Your surroundings shift into a dark red mystical blur with a gigantic iron [vat] in the middle. You gag as you waft the [contents] of the [cauldron] but a faint light appears among the murky [goo]. You hear whispers and make [out] what seems to be [eyelids] flashing open all around you. You make [out] what can only be described as pulsing [veins] in the grey mist illuminated in red. A [pedestal] stands to the northwest of the [cauldron].
That is a wonderful name. "[Look]". It rolls easily off the tongue.
This is the Character Creation room. Please customize [yourself] as you see fit. When you're done, simply QUIT the game.
The [water] stills appears clear. The net is so fine as to be invisible to your eyes.
You appear to be in a shop. [Business] is slow, but it is clear that [fish and chips] are the primary goods sold.
You're standing in the centre of the Delaware Museum of [Cheese]. The room is circular, with the floor designed to look like a gigantic wheel of [cheese]. There are exits in all [directions] except to the north and south.
This room seems to be currently unused, and has nothing remarkable about HOLY CRAP, THERE'S A [BEAR] HERE
A holy place among [cheese] enthusiasts, the Church of [Cheese] is a place where people come and give their thanks for the creation of [cheese]. An [altar] sits at the end of the room, with a [stained glass window] fitted in the [wall] behind it.
This is the [bar] of the museum, famous for its selection of [cheese] infused booze.
An artist's rendition of the paradise humans once lived in: a world made entirely of [cheese]. As many learned at certain religious schools, we were kicked [out] after we served [cheese] straight [out] of the fridge.
This room is a monument to [Novak Djokovic], a tennis champion, philanthropist, and the world's biggest lover of donkey [cheese]. So much so, that he once bought an entire year's production of the most expensive donkey [cheese] for his restaurants.
This room appears to be a small music hall. A modest [stage] sits at the end of the hall, with a [harmonica and stool] set up on it.
Ah! How wonderful. You were just thinking how nice a piece of cheese would be, and look. Here is a pleasant little [cheeseshop], whose [door] beckons to the south.

You are at [Miky Bar], a famous hangout in the old town centre, where every reason is good for eating tons of snacks and belting down any kind of booze. To the east you can reach the main street.
You are in the south [zone] of the [main street]. Around you, there are the [stands] of the book fair, packed with volumes with coloured covers. Westbound, you see the entrance of Miky Bar, while towards the east you can reach the stand of the "Ludo Ergo Sum" club, where your friends are in deep worry for the  missing Cheshire Cat. Northbound, the road continues to other destinations.
You are in front of the [stand] of the "[Ludo Ergo Sum]" club. This part of the book fair is dedicated to the presentation of the new board and [card] games, with the presence of various authors and specialists. However, there is only [Luigi] now, a [tall man] with a gloomy threatening look, who watches the [merchandise] to scare the thieves away. Westbound, you can reach the main street.
You are in the [northern zone] of the [main street]. Even here the roadsides are occupied with the [stands] of the publishers that take part in the book fair. Towards the west there is the entrance of the cinema, towards the east a small square, towards the north a crossroad, while towards the south you go back to the south [zone] of the [street].
You've reached the [crossroad] where the main street meets Liberty Road on the west and [Sun] Street on the east. The [stands] of the book fair are everywhere, but your attention is drawn to the fur coats shop you can see towards the north. To go back to the main street you can go south.
You are on [Liberty Road], always surrounded by the [stands] of the book fair. Towards the west there is the stand of the "Oasis of the Flavour", while towards the east you go back to the crossroad on the main street.
You've entered into a luxurious fur [coats shop], whose [windows] are filled with [furs] of every type, including a very rare kind manufactured with mosquito hairs. Oddly enough, there aren't cat [furs], but you are glad that those adorable felines have been saved from a trend that every year causes the death of millions of animals in the world. Towards the south you go back to the crossroad that faces the main street, while towards the north there is a [passage] that should lead you to the back section of the [shop].
You've reached the gazebo of the "[Oasis] of the [Flavour]", a space displaying all sorts of good things to eat and drink, aiming to promote the most delicious local [products] through generous [samples] offered to the people passing by. However, the most tempting thing on display is the [girl] behind the table who prepares the [samples] and smiles to everybody who takes one. Towards the east you come back to Liberty Road.
It is [dark] and stuffy and you are [covered] over, [something] is all draped over you, it is enough to make you crazy.
This is the middle of the living room, it is all big and vast. But it would be bigger and vaster if there weren't all these [pillows and stuff] in a big [ring] around you.
The [roadside] is [dusty] and dirty, with [sand] blowing all around you in little [dust devils]. The two lane [road] stretches east and west as far as the eye can see. [Corn fields] fill the horizon on [boths] [sides] of the [road].
You are standing beside a large [road] heavily frequented by [cars]. There is nothing but desert in all directions.
The garish [facade] of the [Chunky Chicken Poultry Palace] is behind you, and across the [street] is the only [bank] for miles.
You are standing by the side of a rather narrow [lane] seemingly in the middle of nowhere. [Fields of corn] and wheat line your side of the road as far as the eye can see. The other side of the [dusty] road seems much the same except for looking a bit greener. [Everything] would seem normal, albeit a bit boring, except for the television [cameras] that appear to be hovering in the air  twenty feet above your head.
You're standing on the south side of the [road] you need to cross, an array of [orange traffic cones] before you.
You are in a maze of [orange traffic cones], all alike. Passages lead out to the west, east, and south.
Here above the [cones] the other side of the [road] seems tantalizingly close.
You stand in the middle of a [gravelly] clearing, surrounded on all sides by desolate underbrush -- the kind of desolate underbrush one finds in desolate states such as Wyoming or Rhode Island. The sun burns hot overhead, giving the whole place the feeling of being in a giant deep-fat fryer or something.
A man's home is his castle.Your home is, in fact, a depressing shack at the base of a vermin-infected apartment complex, well within the grimy arabic district. The pungent odor of last [night's] [dinner] fills the air -- you [left] the [chinese food] on your desk (which is right next to your [heater]). The [food] ripened quite nicely [overnight].
The building is dull concrete; the name is stolen from a graduate dormitory. Your lab is one of a row of identical cells; shared by four students, the room is cluttered with equipment and papers. A warm May breeze drifts through the [window].
Overflowing [file cabinets] and cluttered [bulletin boards] everywhere. Some [notices] are yellow with age.
What [started] as a natural canyon has been widened into a [ship] landing site. Light [gray] rhyolite surrounds you, roughly flattened, [walls] carved out of the mountain. Your [ship] rests to the south on its landing treads. To the north is a narrow defile to the main complex that you've been assigned to investigate.
You are contained within four [walls], a [ceiling] and a floor; a [room]. There is nothing special about this [room], which is maybe why it feels so strange. There is nothing to remember it by, save the [video recorder] in the centre; so we could call this [room] the '[video room']. But as there are no other [rooms] around there's no need to be so specific. Lets just call it 'the [room'].
You are in the spacious [foyer] of the MegaCorp Building. The room gives you the feeling of businesslike detachment.
It's the dim, austere [chapel] of the funeral home. Even though you've worked here for the past ten years, you never quite get over the spookiness.
This is a small [room]. [Felix] and you are sitting on [chairs] at a [table] in his [party room]. On the [table] you can see a [newspaper] and a [radio]. You hear [music] from the [radio]. There is a [door] (closed) and you can leave the [room] by going [outside].
Of all the places in the world to obtain the sweet [goodness of Coca-Cola] products, this has to be your favorite. The [Coke machine] dominates the landscape, resting snugly against the perfect brick [wall] next to the unbroken sidewalk, which seems to lead to untold possibilities, their potential unlocked by the mere presence of [Coca-Cola].
Reverd Pearson says a man's home is his fortress. Your home is two rooms of dressed timber, but the roof doesn't leak, so that's fine. Not enough of a fortress to keep out the piskeys, though, it seems. The front [door] is west, and east is where you sleep in back.
You awaken inside your cryogenic chamber, cold and alone. You can see through a foggy [glass door] facing north in the Cryogenic Chamber Room. The room [outside] is pitch black except for a blinking red dot across from your chamber.
The [walls] of this room are made of a sheer, shiny substance that is neither wood nor metal nor plaster nor plastic. They are coloured a rich mountain-sky blue. You see a [small slot] and a [button] in the [wall], inset next to a storage [receptacle]. Exits lead north and west.
A [small] office with [cherry wood walls], it would seem rather cozy and pleasant were it not for the [clutter and litter] of the seeming [reams of paper] in lopsided [stacks and piles] in every [corner] and on every [surface]. Another room can be seen off to the east, and the main exit is south.
You are amused to find yourself in a thoroughly modern [kitchen], its [walls] positively spattered with yellow [batter and white flour]. In the [sink] is a [small riot of dirty dishes and utensils], and various [black pans and pots] sit simmering over [orange flames] leaping from the [stovetop].
In this tiny room, a carpet of debris is broken by [stone]-cut steps leading [back] down into the darkness from [which] you came. Though you got here [late], it looks like those who came before had a great time.
It seems that the last [game] has finally been collected and sorted, leaving the place in a state of loosely-organized [chaos].
Conan is in a damp dungeon, furnished only with an [oaken table]. The [walls] consist of yellowish [clay]. High up on the wall is a single, burning [torch]. A [door], leading north, is closed.
Eerie red [light] floods from the [overhead lamp] attached to the [ceiling] and pours downwards past the [ceiling]-attached [ropes] and hanging [bicycles], casting a frightening array of [shadows] across the vast, concrete floor. Except for the [black, chained-up] [car] on the eastern side of the garage, scarcity of objects is the main feature in this room--the blank, empty [wall] to the west is the epitome of this fact. However, there are a couple of objects of importance that lie to the north, one of which you will be shamefully acquainted with soon.
The blank, naked plaster [wall] stares back at you shamefully; its outer coverings have been stripped off completely, exposing its full, bare surface. Long, fuzzy [bicycle shadows] and the pathetic shadow of yourself are the only images on the [wall], the [light] from the [lamp] from up behind you diffusing onto the [wall]. The center of the garage is back east.
Since the ends of the garage are further away from the central [overhead lamp], there is much more shadow and darkness over here. But that does not matter, because you already know what is here:  other than the huge [poster] occupying the [center], there is not much else on the [wall], save for a [metallic] control [box] with a [wheel] on it lying next to the huge [poster]. Around the [headlight] corner of the [chained-up] [car] behind you, you can also make your way towards the [workbench], which from here is to the southeast. The glowier, and much redder part of the garage is back to the south.
You are in your comfortable living room. There is a room to the north and stairs to the west. You see a comfortable [sofa] which has the [book and cushions] on it.
You are at the bottom of your steep and narrow [staircase]. It goes from your living room to the upstairs.
You are in your brand new gourmet [kitchen]! To the south is your pleasant living room.
The makeshift cell is dust-choked and filled with a [jumble of machine parts, boilers and scrap metal]. This room is old - much older than the Hedonan prison compound that has been built on top of it. Some of the [debris] looks like it has been here since the Nuclear War.
The prison is quite primitive, almost like a cave hewn out of [rock]. Since the prison was built on a [rocky] island in the middle of the sea, the smell of the sea air is quite strong amidst the smell of mildew and the stench of unwashed bodies. A small [window] situated near the [ceiling] allows some sunlight in. A [door] leading out of the prison is to your north.
This is the Harpsichord Room. You persist in calling it that, even though the titular instrument has long since been smashed to bits, it and its dreadful curse. You must admit that the room is quite devoid of life without it; you even tore the curtains from the [windows] after that terrible night, lest the slightest stain of Wilbur's blood incriminate you. Now the only features are a decorative [end table] in the corner, a set of stairs leading to the room above, a [trapdoor] in the floor and a door in the east [wall] that leads [outside].
You have been spending an increasingly large amount of time in the basement. The once intimidating rock [walls] and ancient foundations of previous buildings now seem familiar and comforting. The only way [out] is a well-trodden set of stone steps leading upwards.
The [bedroom] was never well-maintained, even when Wilbur was alive. Now it hasn't been cleaned for some time, and thick films of dust and filth cover [everything]. You're almost certain rats are getting in, but you cannot bring [yourself] to care. Only the ancient [bed] and your old [writing desk] show any sign of recent use.
You are in an utterly featureless white room. [Everything] is painted a flat, spotless, shining white. The fluorescent ceiling lights merge seamlessly with the paintwork, brightly illuminating the room. You can't even see where the door was, so utterly flawless is the constant white.
Everything about the New Delhi Mental Hospital screams "surgical". The uncarpeted floor is so sterilised you almost feel guilty walking on it. There are no corners in the architecture - the [walls] are curved and smooth, painted an insipid pastel blue. The room stretches hugely off in all directions, with the [exit doors] to the south, and an archway labelled "CELL BLOCK 1" to the north.
You are standing at reception, leaning over the [desk] with your elbows resting on the surface. Much of the [wall] before you is decorated with a suitably pacifying work of 2D [art].
You are [outside] the main [elevator] that can take you up to any of the thirty floors that make New Delhi Mental Hospital one of the better-equipped loony bins in the United Coalition. Nearby is a small lounge area, with a ratty-looking sofa and [coffee table].
A busy street running from east to west. Several [eighteen-wheelers] rumble by, on their way either to or from the [truck] stop further down the street. That's not important to you, though: you're more interested in the sidestreet to the north, where the Courier is to make contact with the Roman.
A narrow, dead-end cul-de-sac, practically an alley, the only exit being south to West Avenue. A [phone booth] stands nearby, and you can make out someone standing inside it.
An anonymous-looking [truck stop]. Several [trucks] are parked here, while their patrons dine or sleep or otherwise rest from the road. West Avenue (and your current mission) is back to the west.
High above the [surf, Rocky Point] offers a sweeping [view] of the western [sea]. From this lofty vantage [point], looking south across a narrow strip of [sand], you can clearly see the fractured [granite cliffs] that back the small [cove] below. To the north, the [rugged coastline] is dotted with offshore [rocks and barren [beaches]], swept clear of [sand] by winter [storms].
You are sleeping in bed. Everything is all woozy. The rest of your bedroom is north. Your [alarm clock] sits next to you. Judging by the bullet holes in the wall, the latest in redneck technology lies inside your [pillow].
Slick [sands] meet hard [dirt] marking the boundary of the [road] on your east-hand side, and both fly off endlessly, north and south. A vast [orange] sea of [sand], the [desert], expands [out] to the west.
Silent [machinery] fills the dark spacious hall. There could be clues hiding nearly anywhere.
This is your living room. A huge, dull [rug] is slapped across the floor, a couple of [pictures] are nailed onto the tatty [walls]. The front door is to the north, and a set of stairs go up.
The only object at all in this room is the [bed], which is made of solid oak and suspended from the [ceiling] by chains.
A wide, deserted, sandy road runs north to south. Tufts of bright green grass dot it randomly. Dense [trees] line either side of the street.
You are at a dead end. Brick [walls] block every direction, except back west. There is, however, an open window in the northern [wall].
You are standing before a bizarre [machine], bizarre beyond description. The bits of it that seem most likely to be of use are a [large red button] and a spout above a [tray].
From overhead the [sun] makes you squint, and the [wind] swirls [sand] around your feet as you press on eastward.
In the shade of a tall dune is this stand of [olive trees]. The [wind] has slowed to a warm [breeze], making the branches bow over a [pool of water] glistening underneath. The land drops off sharply to the south.
This [old road], coming from the village, runs north to the edge of the [forest]. Alongside it to the west is the [rushing] [water] of the [river Aarkland]. The [river flows] through the [forest] and divides it in [two]: To the east is the [old forest], and to the west is the [forbidden forest].
The collection of [stones] is over [ten] paces from edge to edge. The [top] has been [flattened] to create a [platform] and that is where [Lornedei] stands. No new [stones] have been added in several hundred years. Despite the lack of activity, nothing grows near the [stones].
The [river] runs from north to south. Ahead of her, the glittering [water] becomes shaded by the [two forests]. The [forbidden forest] on the left and the still green [old forest] on the right. The [river] disappears [out] of sight perhaps a hundred paces into the tunnel of [trees, water, and shadows]. The dusty [road] is east, where [she] can get [out] of the [water]. [She] can also dive down to the bottom of the [river].
There's a sudden splash just behind [Lornedei]. [She] turns around in the [water]. There is nothing there but some quickly fading rings on the [surface].
A magical world reveals itself. The [river] continues north. The [bottom] is mostly composed of [sand, rocks], some [mud], and quickly fleeing fish. All kinds of things have been thrown in the [river] from the road and are now resting under a layer of [sand] until the end of time.
The [forbidden forest] is to the west and the old [forest] to the east. The [river flows] back south and down takes her to the bottom of the [river]. To the north the [river] disappears [out] of sight around a bend, and there is a slight [opening] in the [trees] to the east.
The [grass] grows waist high. Touched by [sun], wind, and rain, it patiently waits for the farmers that will not come. The edge of the [old forest] lies close by to the north. To the south, a [big pile of stones] rises [above] the [grass]. The [road] is back west.
It's harder to see here. The [river] flows from north to south. The [mud] swirls up, preventing her from seeing more than a few arm lengths ahead. The old trees reach [out] their [roots] under the [water]. They [crowd] the [bottom] along with [swaying vegetation and rocks].
A [narrow path] leads east into the [forest]. All is still. The old [forest] surrounds her.
A dry [black leaf] drops down on [Lornedei's] shoulder. With a grimace, [she] flicks it with a [finger] to get rid of it.
A dry [black leaf] drops from the [forbidden forest] into the [water] right in front of [Lornedei]. It bobs up and down a couple of times before it floats away downstream.
The [river] makes a slight turn, hiding the road from view. A [vertical cliff] stops her from going any further north in this tunnel of [water, trees, and shadows]. [Above] her head is a frayed ribbon of blue [sky] and at the [top] of the [cliff], the [two forests] meet. [Below] and around her there is that play of light and dark, maybe just a little bit darker. South takes her back around the [bend]. Looking down [she] can see an opening in the [cliff].
The [bottom] is littered with [rocks]. There are piles of them of varying sizes, washed clean by the constant flow of [water]. Around the sides of the [opening] into the [cave], a few colonies of a [slimy] and sickly [green] plant have managed to make a home. They sway back and forth in the current while clinging desperately to the [rocks]. The [opening] leads northwest into a [cave] and south takes her back around the [river] bend.
Darkness is chased away by only a few illusive reflections in the stone, thanks to the little [light] leaking in from the opening. The tunnel continues west into total darkness and Southeast takes her [out] of the [cave].
The [clearing] is perfectly round and it's surrounded by the [old forest] in all directions. A [giant oak tree] stands in solitude a short distance into the hall of [trees], separated from the wall of [birch], ash, silver [pine] and the myriad of other plants growing there. The barely visible [path] through the [forest] is to the west.
She is standing between the [big oak] and the dense forest. Southeast or southwest will take her back to the open clearing. [Steps] are cut in the [big oak].
The [shadow] of the [big oak] trembles on the [ground below]. The far end of the [branch Lornedei] is sitting on seems to disappear in a gray [mist]. The other [two branches] on this level are just as unreachable for her as the [limbs] higher up.
You are standing in what used to be the control room of your spaceship, but after the attack it looks more like a junkyard. The only usable exit is north, as the others are covered by a delicate patina of squashed solid-state circuitry. A ruined [console] lies to one side, barely operating. Only one [button] seems to be functional. There is some [explosive] on the floor, with a self-igniting [fuse].
The [door] to the northeast was jammed on landing and won't open.
You are in what used to be the engine room of your ship, only in the landing the cargo hold has been concertinaed into it. What's left of the motor will not, alas, be responsible for any more flights. There is a port south, and a [doorway] leading northeast to the outside world.
Inside [Room 401] (on your wooden [swivel chair]) Somebody once mentioned that your [office] sure could use a [woman's] touch. (As a matter of fact, so could you.) Its only saving grace is the break you get on the rent, thanks to that job you did for the landlord a couple years ago. Saved his sister, a mousy little thing but don't tell [him], from making the mistake of her life. Your landlord thanks you every chance he gets. His sister hates you.
Inside [Room 401] Somebody once mentioned that your [office] sure could use a [woman's] touch.
Your [Room], on the [bed] You're in your [room] in the [Red] Boar Inn.
Your [Room] You're in your [room] in the [Red] Boar Inn.
Tiny [cracks] and crumbling [plaster]. A grey [ceiling] dominates your view. Your back rests against something hard and cool.
People cluster near the [guard [rails]] overlooking the [trench]. Glowing [advertisements] are spaced at regular intervals on the walls.
Papers layer the surface of her desk, some spilling on the floor. [Candy wrappers and pop cans] overflow from the [trash bin]. Smoke rises from an [ashtray] lined with cigarette butts. Her [computer] hums faintly.
[Jonas] stands in his nightrobe, arms crossed, flickering occasionally.
"But round the [grot] we gaze; and all we view, in order ranged our admiration drew: the bending [shelves] with loads of [cheeses] press'd, the folded [flocks each] separate from the rest in [pens] (the [larger] here, and there the [lesser lambs] in [fence], the [new-fallen] [young] here bleating for their [dams]: the [kid] distinguish'd from the [lambkin] lies); the [cavern] echoes with responsive cries. Capacious [chargers] all around were laid. Full [pails, and vessels] of the [milking] trade. With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store my [friends] advise me, and to quit the shore. Or drive a flock of [sheep and goats] away, consult our safety, and put off to sea. In the [cavern], warmt by [fire, dust] is everywhere, even near the great [mat of bands, bed] of the [monster]".
This is a quaint room with white carpets, walls and minimal furniture. A teeny veranda pokes [out] to the north, barely big enough for your slim self to stand on. Your Ensuite is east and the bedroom door is southeast.
You live in a Townhouse complex filled with many small houses crammed together. This is a safe, little community of friendly neighbours. A path to the west leads [out] to the main road. The nearest place is Aspley Hypermarket, which is only 2 minutes down the road.
Here is the Pick'n'Pay shopping centre. Once inside, you can see the Coles Supermarket is northwest, the Post Office is east, the Butcher is northeast and the Florist is next [door] to that.
The unique thing about the Hypermarket is the variety of products and the low prices. You can pick up [everything] from groceries to electronics. The Beauty parlour is north and the floristry is northeast. The Exit is southeast.
This is a small Parlour run by a Chinese family. Here, you can get all of your beauty needs fulfilled from [massage] to [manicure]. The Florist is East and go south through Coles to exit.
You have ordered native Australian [flowers]. These [flowers] are hardy and can last days without water or preservation -perfect for a morning ceremony! You need to pay $180 and collect your order. [Flo] is here selling [flowers]. The Beauty Parlour is west.
A typically suburban butcher. A few chubby apprentices work here. The [meat] is always more expensive than the supermarket and not much better in quality. Just northwest of here, you find what you are looking for, Flo's Floristry.
You can see a [bench], a [Shelves] and a [counter] here.
In the Ensuite is a [cupboard] and a [bathroom]. Your [Wedding Outfit] hangs here in it's protective cover, ready to be packed into the car. Your bedroom is west.
The [walls] are [painted] black with simple architectural motifs, except for the cunning [panel of three] green [pears] and a [pitcher of water]. The [glass] is [painted] so that light seems to fall through it from the [window], and the [pears] are luscious enough to eat.
Hidden in the bowels of the mountain, this chamber has hosted your immortal body for centuries, while your foolish enemies spent their miserable days hunting for you in your castle. The [coffin] is on a stone [pedestal] at the centre of the room. On the [ceiling] is a [fresco] of the red [sun of Valmar]. To the east a narrow [tunnel] leads to the other rooms of your lair.
You're walking through the east-west [tunnel] which connects the crypt with the other rooms of the lair. It is a narrow [passage] with [walls] of irregular [stone], through which no one had ever dared to pass before the arrival of the miserable fools who (temporarily) put an end to your life.
You've reached the wide, octagonal [chamber] that is at the centre of the lair. The [walls] and the [ceiling] are [covered] with menacing black [bats], the background showing a murky black [cave] scattered with innumerable [stalactites and stalagmites]. To the west you may return to the crypt; to the north, east and south [three] dark [passages] lead to the other [rooms] of the lair.
Painted on the [walls], the floor and the [ceiling], the giant [spiders] that surround you make for rather disquieting company, even for you. Although perfectly still and little more than stylised drawings, they appear to be extraordinarily alive with shiny yellow eyes and wide open [mandibles].
You are in a small painted black room that appears to be a [temple]. You can see a [kneeling stool] in front of a large [painting] with a golden [frame], hung on the back [wall]. The subject of the [picture] is Lilith, the gorgeous and cruel vampire who, more than a thousand years ago, threw you in this bloody abyss of darkness, letting you drink her blood after having pierced your jugular with her long, sharp canines so many times.
The [books] that fill the [shelves] of your [library] have been your best friends over the centuries. With their engaging stories they helped you to cope with the loneliness in which every vampire is forced to spend most of his life. At the centre of the [room] is a [desk] still covered with [papers]; behind it you can see a priceless [human-skin armchair]. To the east you return to the spiders [room].
It's kind of messy here. You probably don't want to look much at your desk or your bed. You probably should just grab what you can and get going before going [outside].
A quiet street, unsettlingly quiet at this time of night. The dim [gaslights] barely penetrate the [thick fog] which has come rolling in on the Thames; you can't even see the other side of the street from here. A large [poster] has been pasted next to the theatre entrance, which lies to the north.
The tattered silk [wallpaper] in this room was once a deep, rich red. Over the years it has faded to more of a livid, bruised maroon, betraying the current state of things at the Orpheum. The elegant inlays on the tile floor are scuffed and dingy, littered with crumpled playbills and the stubs of old cigars. Narrow staircases at [each] end of the lobby lead upward, while the auditorium lies to the north. The box office is to the east, its shade now drawn.
This long, skinny room behind the stage is a clutter of [dressing tables], sundry props, and racks of costumes. A doorway to the south leads backstage.
The light from the stage to the east makes shines through the rigging of the curtains and makes long, strange shadows against the brick [wall]. A stairwell in the corner leads under the stage.
Unlike James' office, yours is the very model of cleanliness and organization. The [walls] are unadorned, the furniture sparse. A door to the north goes backstage.
You see cars and trucks in the parking lot. It is sunny [outside].
You walk into the [Nuclearer] Weapons. You see amazing things in here.
The skate park is the place where do tricks on your [bike] or skateboard.
Darkness surrounds you. Fingers of [dragon] flame reach towards your ankles and arms.
Gleaming [lights] cover the [walls]. Several [big screens] are [active]. Some show the [surface] of strange, [unknown worlds]. Some [display] nothing more than [stars]. A [big chair] in the middle of the room looks like a [throne] and anyone sitting here must look very powerful indeed. It is clear that this is the heart of the evil empire. This is the centre of war and destruction. This is the office of Emperor Jacklejitt III.
South [Lawn] You are on a wide [lawn] just north of the entrance to the [Robner] estate. Directly north at the [end] of a pebbled [path] is the [Robner house], flanked to the northeast and northwest by a vast expanse of well-kept [lawn]. Beyond the [house] can be seen the lakefront.
Front [Path] You are at the [Robners'] front [door], which is closed. You can walk around the [house] from here to the east or west. To the south a rolling [lawn] leads to the entrance of the estate.
East of Front [Door] You are in front of the [Robner house] just east of the front [door]. A small [window], closed and securely locked, is the only thing of [note] here. To the northeast is the east side of the [house]. The ornately carved [cornerstone] of the [house] is nearby.
East [Lawn] You are on a neatly manicured [lawn], east of the [house], which extends north and east to the shore of a [lake]. To the northwest is a peaceful orchard, and toward the south another wide [lawn]. Southeast, beside the [lake], is a small [shed] with a solitary [dirty] [window]. Mr. [McNabb] is off to the northwest.
Orchard [Path] You are on a [path] at the edge of a small orchard of fruit [trees] which abuts the eastern side of the back of the [house]. The orchard is obviously intended more to display the beauty of the blossoms in spring than to produce significant amounts of fruit. The [windows] of the [kitchen] look out onto the orchard, although your view of them is blocked by the [trees] and a small grape arbor. To the west is a [path] along a [rose garden, and lawns] sweep out to the north and east.
West [Lawn] This is a sprawling [lawn] west of the [Robner house]. To the west and north is the [lake] shore. To the northeast is a [rose garden], and to the south another wide [lawn].
[Garden Path] You are at the edge of a large rose [garden], meticulously maintained by the [gardener], Mr. [McNabb]. He is said to be exceedingly proud of this particular [garden], which is the envy of the neighbors. Rows of [roses] are neatly arranged and the sweet fragrance of the flowers is worth a trip here in itself. An orchard to the east contains many varieties of fruit trees and wide [lawns] lie to the west and north. The [roses] themselves are to the south, filling the area between you and the back of the [house].
West Side of [House] There are no doors or [windows] at [ground] level here on the west side of the [house]. A beautiful [rose garden], separated by a tall [fence], lies to the north, and the front of the [house] is to your south. A large [lawn] bordering the lake lies to the west.
Among the [Roses] You are among rows of [roses]. The [ground] is soft, and your footsteps leave a rather bad impression as many poor seedlings are trampled underfoot. A [safer] place to admire the flowers lies to the north. A [window] to the south allows a view into the [house]. There is no way into the [house] from here. Mr. [McNabb] is here. He seems pretty angry about something.
Mr. [McNabb] heads off to the north.
You notice a very faint ringing sound coming from the [house].
North [Lawn] This idyllic spot lies on a jut of land well north of the [house] and is surrounded on three sides by [lake] shore. Its charm includes the sweet smell of [roses] blown on a southwest [breeze] from the rose [garden] and by the sound of the leaves rustling in the orchard to the southeast. Mr. [McNabb] is here, picking weeds.
Mr. [McNabb] is here, wiping his brow.
Mr. [McNabb] is off to the east.
Mr. [McNabb] is off to the southeast.
To the east Mr. [McNabb] comes into view from the east.
Mr. [McNabb] is walking past you.
Mr. [McNabb] heads off to the south.
Mr. [McNabb] is here, cutting fresh flowers.
Mr. [McNabb] is off to the west.
In the Orchard You are amidst lovely [trees] bearing apples, pears, peaches, and other fruits. A [grape arbor] and several berry [bushes] may also be seen. The [kitchen] [window] and east side of the [house] are just to your south, and a [path] skirts the orchard to your north.
Mr. [McNabb] is here, pruning stems. He seems quite worked up and is talking aloud to [himself].
Mr. [McNabb] is here, planting seeds.
West of Front Door You are in front of the [Robner house] just west of the front door. To the north is a large bay [window] through which can be seen part of the living [room]. To the northwest is the west side of the [house].
East Side of [House] There are no [windows] or entries of any kind here at the east side of the [house]. To the north is the orchard, and the front [lawn] lies to the south. A [lawn] also slopes down toward the shore of a lake to the east.
[Shed] This small [garden shed] is filled with implements of [gardening and lawn] care. [Shelves] filled with various [tools] line the [walls] and a filthy [window] looks out on the [lawn]. Leaning in a [corner] is a wooden [ladder].
Mr. [McNabb] is here, mowing the [grass].
Mr. [Baxter], off to the south, disappears from sight to the north.
Mr. [McNabb] is to the northwest, heading toward the southeast.
Mr. [McNabb] heads off to the east.
Mr. [McNabb] is here, examining his work.
A car pulls up the drive to the south, and Mr. [Coates] steps out onto the [lawn].
To the northwest Mr. [McNabb] comes into view from the south. To the west Mr. [Coates] comes into view from the south.
Mr. [Coates], off to the west, disappears from sight to the north.
Mr. [McNabb] is here, pruning the [trees].
[McNabb] places the [ladder] he was carrying on the [ground].
A [fisherman] is standing in a poor [boat] not many paces from the shore, pulling in a net. Only a few fish are twitching in the net.
Bookshelves line the walls of the room. It has taken you years, your entire life to build up this [library], but now you must abandon it. Your [grand piano stands] heavily in a corner of the room, [notes] for your newest [composition] lined up along the [music stand]. The high [window] along the south wall is your only hope of escape, as your poor friend - now your zombified ex-friend - [Claude Debussy] lurks outside the [door] to the west.
The full [moon] shines down through a high valley in the surrounding [mountains], illuminating the hardy, though [bare trees] and the slightly shaggy browning [grass] in this small cemetery.
This is the finely appointed [recording studio] where episodes of the Tell Don't Show Podcast are produced with some primo [recording equipment] sitting on a [table] next to the wall. Behind you is the [door out] of the [studio].
The Commons is a grand, breathtaking vista of previously unimaginable beauty. At this time of the day, it's usually filled with students waiting for their parents to pick them up. Oddly enough, it's completely empty now. Long [stone benches], showing [evidence] of recent occupation in the form of spilled [gatorade], have been placed in a rough L shape in the center of the room. A hallway runs to the west, the east, and the north. To the south is the entrance (and exit) to the school.
Welcome to shit town. [Everything] seems to be covered in feces, for some reason. This hallway used to have [lockers], until they were all converted into trophy cases, memorials, and other bullshit which are nothing special to look at. The gym, to the west, is totally closed off. To the south is The Office.
Lockers and locked [classrooms] galore. The north parking lot is to the, er, north. The Commons is back to the south.
There are [lockers and classrooms] as far as the eye can see, but they're all locked. The floor is surprisingly clean - even the [water fountain] is shiny. The janitors must have just come through. The hallway continues to the east, while the commons lie to the west.
The [lockers] finally taper off on the northern wall, instead replaced by large [windows] indicating that you have reached the library. Cyndy's room is to the south. The Freshman Wing, to the northeast, is closed for renovations. The library lies to the north.
Gordon is at the end of the room, shouting about a shitty new argument he just thought of or banging Ashlynn or whatever the hell he talks about. [Reasoner] sits at a [desk], pasting pieces of paper from Cross-X.com to other pieces of paper with "[Reasoner]" and "Iowa City West" written on them.
A barely organized room full of stupid [junk], stupid [toys], and stupid people. A particularly [ugly bear], hanging from the ceiling by the neck, serves as a warning to those who would do [Cyndy] or her trinkets harm. The disembodied [heads] she keeps on stakes around her [desk] communicate a similar message. [Trophies] which emphasize her great success as a [debate] coach line the walls. [Cyndy] sits at her [desk], playing some crappy game on her computer.
Four damp dry-[stone walls], and a cold [wind] turning to cast [rain] through the only [window], rattling at the [door] as it goes. Your [herd] is here, clustered on the drier side of the [straw]-strewn floor, next to the [feeding] [trough].
The glitterings of [Gold, Jewels, Tapestries], &c. belie the Corruption of he who 'til recently occupied this [high Seat]. A [white Carpet], once flanked by Sycophants & Counsellors, now lies untravelled. It leads away from the [Seat] & towards the [Sunrise].
A richly attired Wait Chamber, its [walls] covered in [pagan Frescoes] which beckon you to impure thoughts. [Chairs] arranged near the circular perimeter mingle with [Tables] for [gaming]. The chamber becomes the Reception Chamber to the west, the Dining Hall to the north. A small tiled archway leads southwest & to the east is the grand Entry Hall.
On feast days in years & months past, Lords & favored Thinkers entered this [long] Hall from the south, to be served by huge platters of exotic repast from the Kitchen to the west. But now the room stands bare, stripped of its Appointments by some fleeing servant. Only the [larger] items remain--the [long Table] & the [ornate Chairs].
Gluttonous indeed were the the Feasts prepared in this Kitchen while the Baron lived. The huge [Ovens] now stand [cold] & [unlit], the [Crockery] smashed & strewn about the floor. The Dining Hall is to the east, & northwards is a small enclosed Yard. A [Stair] leads downward into darkness.
In this small, [walled] Yard were Beasts put to the knife & prepared for the master's feasting table. Unthinkably--but undoubtably--were other Prey too destroyed here, to feed the Baron's appetite for sin. There is no hiding place in this small Arena; meat, alive or [dead], can escape only south, through the Kitchen.
The gloomy Store Room has been recently [sacked], though [racks of Ham] & [strings] of dried [Fruit] still hang above your head. A [bag of Flour] has been [ripped open], its contents scattered. Hundreds of [white Foot-Prints] run frantic around the room & up the [Stair].
O foul Hypocrite! O [whited] Sepulchure! In the midst of his debauchery the Baron does see fit to erect [himself] a Chapel of the faith! Mayhap he thought to take sanctuary here at your approach. 'Tis more likely the [lighted] [Candles] & [marble Altar] did bear witness to blasphemous & terrible Rites in the Baron's lifetime.
In contrast to the Baron's opulence lurks here the spartan Cell of his [corrupt Priest]. The only furnishing is a [straw Mat], the only concession to Luxury a tapestry which hangs near the upward-climbing [stair].
Your cozy kitchen is very useful for making all sorts of [things], but especially Delicious Breakfast! And you just love your new [curtains]! They go great with the [window]!
Tall [branches] of pale [blue coral] poke up from clusters of [seaweed], glittering in the [sunlight] that filters down through lapping [waves]. The [reef] clears away to what you for some reason perceive as east and west, perfectly calm, still. Almost eerily so. But
But Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu, playing through in your mind, soothes away all [tension].
Here the [seafloor] drops away abruptly as a [watery] [rift] slices downward out of sight between [two] jagged rock [walls]. Both sides of the [fissure] are crowded with the [polyps] of large [anemones], flecked in sun-dappled pastel shades. Their many [calyces] grasp at you from all directions, but you wisely keep your distance.
The heart of the [Project], in the form of complex electrical [devices] linked together by a maze of [coaxial cable], packs this small underground [laboratory] to capacity. Exits lead off in nearly every [compass] direction, and a set of disused cement [steps] descends into darkness.
[Justy's] quarters are just as sparsely furnished as yours, with only a [bed, desk], and a few of [Justy's] personal belongings.
[Cynthia's] quarters are just as sparsely furnished as yours, with only a [bed, desk], and a few of [Cynthia's] personal belongings.
Fluorescent [lights] cast a harsh, blurry [glare] on [bundles of cable] stretching overhead, and on metal [walls], not quite reflective. The [glare] breaks at a [doorway] in the south [wall], and at the west end of the east-west corridor, outside Dr [Shimada's] [office].
A rather stark infirmary, with cold [cement [walls]] and floor lit by a single flickering [fluorescent] [bulb]. It feels more like a morgue than a [medical] facility. An exit leads north.
Ironic proof against the aphorism that [supercomputers] are shrinking dominates this section of the lab. The [walls] and narrow walkways enclose the Project's brain, an enormous [Cray ZMP-20]10X whose size is directly proportional to its awesome processing power. Equally large [racks of storage media] occupy the [four] corners.
Dank and cold, these facilities contain only the usual fixtures -- [toilet, shower stall], and a dripping, rust-stained [washbasin]. On the [wall] above the last is an off-[colour rectangle, where] a [mirror once hung], but no longer.
You have always enjoyed this diner before, but now it just feels forced. [Tacky attempts] at [some sort of art deco] diner [atmosphere] crowd all around you. Nothing feels right. [Jim] sits across the from [table] from you, silent but supportive. A listless [rain] pours on [outside].
The tide buffets you constantly in the tight confines between mounds of brown [sand] which barely break through the [watery] surface. [Clouds of sediments and silt] whirl about you, stirred by the cresting [waves], and it's difficult to maneuver.
Living [Room] You are standing in the living [room] of a large house. The [room] is bare except for a small, square [table] in the center of the [room]. An oak [door] to the east opens into a darkened area and a mahogany [door] to the south is closed. Above the mahogany [door] is an old [sign] with some faded [lettering]. A shiny brass [lantern] is sitting in the center of the [table].
Your living room, a study in chaos. A [couch], piled with [stuff]. A [carpet], piled with [junk]. A door, leading north to the kitchen. Another door, going west to the bedroom. And lots and lots of other [mess].
They say home is where you hang your hat. Or, in your case, lay your [mattress]. Unlike the rest of the apartment, this room is fairly empty. the living room is back to the east.
The kitchen is a room of air and light. Or it would be, if you could ever open a window and get some breeze. Too bad it's painted shut. There are the usual kitchen [implements] here, including a [sink] and a [stove], as well as a [table] overflowing with [papers]. The living room is to the south, and the bathroom to the west.
The bathroom is small yet cozy. Amazingly, the [tub] is sparkling clean. The kitchen is back to the east.
This room is hellishly lit with red light from an unclear source. Identical, perfectly circular corridors lead off to the north, south, east, and west, and a ladder leads through identically shaped circles in the [ceiling] and floor.
Sitting on top of a [white picket fence], you can see several [children] playing in a [backyard], and a larger [yard] behind you. You can get 'down' anytime you wish.
The [children's] [yard] is [small] with a [slide] in the middle.
A darkened [foyer], presided over by a [security desk] near the north [wall]. Floating [above] it in the capacious [darkness] is a small [landing]. A [set of stairs both] rises up to meet it and stretches downwards into the dark.
A small [landing], hanging in the still [darkness above] the [foyer].
You are [onstage], a [wide expanse] of blank floor facing onto [darkness]. Nestled behind a [curtain's] edge is the [exit] leading [offstage].
A [room] of indefinite size, hemmed in with high [curtains, hanging ropes, and cluttered] with [wardrobes and make-up tables]. Various [props] lie scattered about the [room]. Through the [curtains], an [entrance] leads [onstage].
You're in [Skry] Im, a collection of [ramshackle] cottages and [shops] at the crossroads of the [King's Highway] and the [Way] of the [Sea]. One such [ramshackle] [shop] can be found to the northeast: [Merchant Guy's Specialty Minerals and Archery Supplies]. Also there's a [ramshackle] [inn] to the southwest.
This store has a peculiar array of items for sale, although the [shelves] are largely empty now. Hard times all round, you suppose. Curious-looking rocks and [crystals] can be had at various prices, and there are a few [pieces] of basic [archer's equipment] for sale as well. A [sign] notes that the [archery equipment] is on [clearance].
You've always liked the library, but now that it has your perfect Halloween costume it's even better. A [few shelves of rare books] line the [walls], but the true treasure is in the center.
Twisting, crystalline passages carved [out] of pink ice and muddy rock lead down deep into the planetoid core. Tremors pulsate through your feet, up your spine, and shifting rock and newly-[ground] sand tumble from overhead cracks, drifting slowly downward in the near-zero gravity.
The mining tunnel dead ends here, [two] meters south of the [signal] emitter, at a [solid rock wall].
The [sand box] has always been your favorite part of the [playground]. Sometimes, you bring your toy soldiers here and have great battles in the middle of an endless desert. Other times, Ken and Barbie become Frankie and Annette for a game of Beach Blanket Bingo. Today, you want to play dinosaurs. It's too bad you forgot to bring them with you.
This is the only part of the [playground] that's paved. A tall [post] rises out of the [ground], with a [basketball] [hoop] at the top of it. You've always liked [basketball], and are pretty good at it for your age, but the big kids never let you play with them. The [sandbox] is across the [playground] to the south, while the [swings and slide] are to the east and west.
At the east end of the [playground] is a large [swingset]. Three [broad black rubber straps] are attached by means of [metal [chains]] to a [tall steel frame]. If you were a bit older, you might think that seemed a bit kinky, but you're not. The [sandbox] is south, the [slide] is west, and the [basketball] [hoop] is north.
This is the west corner of the [playground], where the [slide] is. The [grass] has grown up [taller] here than in the other parts of the [playground], and is really due to be mown. A [large metal slide] dominates this area, while the [sand box, swing set, and basketball] [hoop] are to the south, east, and north respectively.
You are standing by the [side] of a [road]. [Cars] drive past at a break-neck speed, bumper to bumper, their motors [growling], their horns honking, in their frenetic attempt to get somewhere. The [road], running east to west, runs to your north. South of you is a small clearing. Everywhere else is [jungle].
The front of the [small cabin] is almost entirely occupied with [navigational] [instruments], a [radar display, and radios] for calling back to shore. Along [each] side runs a [bench] with faded [blue vinyl cushions], which can be lifted to reveal the [storage space] underneath. A [glass case] against the wall contains several [fishing rod].
The [Ergomatic Wing] crash-landed (it knows no other variety) amid a clump of wilted-looking [thornbushes] and unaccomodating [rocks]. Sun-bleached [grass] extends in every direction, but the southern prospect is improved by [Fort] Yaourt-[Framboise]. And floating above it, the sublime bulges of the [Spirit], cruelly tethered by French guile.
[Ballroom], Near [Bar] This is the south end of the [ballroom], at the [bar]. Elsewhere in this large [ballroom], there are scores of other [party] guests dressed in all sorts of outlandish [costumes]. On the dance floor are some of the older dancers. The [band] is playing "[Breathless]." On the periphery of the [room] small [groups] can be seen, [discussing] everything from politics to local scandals. The [bartender] is busy behind the [bar], his only concession to the [party] a small [domino mask]. [Samuel Ostmann], enjoying [himself] hugely as a [vampire], is here.

Here the front [hall] and a long north-south [hall] fronting the [ballroom] intersect.
Living [Room] This is a large and comfortable living [room]. The decor is formal, and the stern [faces] of several generations of [Ashcrofts] peer down from [portraits] above you. A pair of large [doorways] open out to the [hall] on the south wall, flanking a marble [fireplace]. An ornately [carved] [mantel] surmounts the [fireplace]. Wide [windows] peer out over the [garden] to the north. There is a [telephone] on an end [table] to the right of the [sofa].
This is a large and comfortable living [room].

An Interactive Heeling Copyright (c) 1998 by Mr. [WiggleButt].
A long asphalt strip, leading north to Freeblewhizz Road. On the curb near the end of the [drive] is your [mailbox].
This is [Freeblewhiz] [Road], which happens to be the main [road] in this tiny burgh. The [road] continues to the north and you can see your driveway back to the south. You have just passed milemarker 001
You just passed milemarker 002 on [Freeblewhizz] [Road]. This just happens to be the junction of [Freeblewhizz] & [Whizbang].
You are on [Whizbang Road], which happens to run east and west through this area. It is a rather plain [road] covered in asphalt and in an apparent contradiction to it's name, there is absolutely nothing spectacular to look at here, in fact the [road] is sort of boring. You are currently at mile marker 2
At one time this was a center of higher education for dogs, where a puppy could learn the 3 R's (roaming, running and retching). However in recent years the facility has fallen into a state of disrepair, and is currently overgrown with [weeds]. The front door and [window both] appear to have been nailed shut. Off to the south you can see a wooded area.
Wigglebutt's was once a single room [schoolhouse] for dogs. Most of the room has been trashed by visiting dogs, but for some odd reason, there is a [refrigerator] against the [wall], which appears to be still running (odd, since no one has paid the electric bill for about 3 years).
There is a large enclosed barn [yard] here, to the east is a gate which leads to red barn
You are standing at the edge of a small [pond]. The light breeze blowing today ripples the surface and makes this a very tranquil area. Towards the center of the [pond] you can see circular ripples which are being made by some [fish] feeding near the surface. Nearby you can see some tracks in the mud that were apparently made by the sheep when they come here to drink. There is also some other [evidence] that the sheep stop by here regularly also (namely sheep [poop])
You crouch in your wrath. The dark sky howls. [Barrels] surround you.
You're standing in a hallway that extends to the north and south, a single [painting] the only feature adorning its [walls]. The [door] to the toilet is west.
Your are standing at the front of your [house] that's to the south in your normal and very beautiful [neighborhood]. So beautiful in fact that it even got your lazy bum to start planting [flowers] at your front home , just to keep up with your [neighbors]. It was peak peace and joy, this place. Except for that thing.
Since it's the middle of the night, you're the only person here. This part time job as a janitor is a great coverup: no one will ever figure out that you're a super spy from the future, who has returned to prevent the destruction of North Dakota. Unless they play this game, but how many people are likely to do that? The [counter] is to the north, and the exit is south.
It was good fortune to find this abandoned [hut]. Secluded, yet not far from Borphee or Pheebor, it is a perfect site for your new base of operations.
This is a [rocky] [shore] along the north bank of The One [River]. The [surface] under your feet is hard and jagged which makes walking on it slightly difficult.
As you look around, something catches your eye in the distance to the southwest. It appears to be some kind of manmade [structure].
The [sand] on this quiet [beach] is cool and moist and a welcome relief to your tired feet.
This is a well-traveled dirt [road] which stretches as far as you can see in [both] the east and west directions. There is also a small path leading south.
The [hungus] has nearly reached the south [shore].
You are standing on a small [patch of dry] land located on the western edge of a [murky swamp]. The One [River] lies south, but you dare not go [further] into the [swamp], for you will surely sink. The [hungus] climbs up onto the south [shore] of the [river] and disappears into the [bush].
This is a long stretch of road leading east and west with [fields of tall grass] on either side.
This is a long stretch of road leading east and west with [fields of tall grass] flanking either side of it.
You are standing before a large city gate which marks the entrance to the proud City of Pheebor. Two stone pillars adorn [each] side of the east/west road leading into the city. The pillars are joined by an ornate wrought iron archway with the name Pheebor proudly accented in gold-leaf.
This is the City [Plaza] - A [large] square which serves as the trade and cultural center of the city. Government buildings occupy the northeast, northwest and southwest corners of the square while, in the center, a [large stone arch] is under construction. Two streets, one north, one west, cut between the buildings and into the city. The south is bounded by a massive [wall] which surrounds and fortifies the entire city while a [large] gate leads out of the city to the east.
This is the east end of [River Street], which continues west from here. An [alleyway] between [buildings] to the south leads back to the Plaza.
You are standing outside the [Institute of Science and Technology] building. It is a very impressive building with large stone columns, and an open doorway.
At the Institute, they don't waste much space on glamor or glitz. There is no foyer, no reception, no murals or mosaic tiled floor. Just a simple hallway with [doors] lining the [walls] on [each] side. At the south end of the hall is the open [doorway], and at the north end is an [elevator].
What first strikes you about Prof.Einboz' office is that it is as neat as a pin. [Bookcases] line two of the [walls], a [blackboard] covers the third and the entrance and filing [cabinets] take up the last. In the center of the office sits the professor's [desk]. Next to the [desk] is a [wastebasket].
You have never used an [elevator] before and are now standing right next to one. On the [wall] beside the [elevator] is a [narrow slot].
This massive and ornately designed [Royal Palace] is truly impressive. It appears to be configured in an 'L' shape, stretching along the north and west borders of the Plaza while [guards] stand ready along the entire perimeter.
You are standing outside the [Pheebor Public Library].
You are standing on [Center Street], which runs north and south. You see a [Coffee House] on the west side of the [street] while a gap between [some buildings] leads back to the Plaza.
Customers sit quietly at small round [tables] sipping [coffee] and reading the latest best-sellers. In the corner, a [folk guitarist] softly strums a quiet melody while the [proprietor] is busy behind the [counter] grinding and blending [coffee] beans.
This is a corner junction where River Street and Center Street join. River Street continues toward the east, and Center Street leads south. Some [high-rise] [condominiums] occupy the corner on the north and west sides.
Row upon row of [bookcases] are reflected in the glistening tile floor that stretches endlessly before you.
Judging by the [dust] on the [vanity] and the melted [lamp], I don't think this [bedroom] has been used in a long time, except by yours truly. It's rather stately, though. I've never slept in a [canopy bed] before. [Everything] looks antique and hand-carved. There's Victorian [wallpaper] on the [walls], and the floor is [polished wood].
The hallway is dark and quite narrow--there's barely enough room for me to stretch [out] my arms. There's this [weird painting] on the wall, too.
Here's fun! This room with the high ceiling is clearly an abandoned [kitchen]. I don't see any food anywhere, but with a wooden [table], a [brick oven] built into one of the walls, and a [cabinet] on the opposite wall with a [counter] on top, it's difficult to conclude anything other than "[kitchen]". What's especially great about this [kitchen], in my opinion, is that an iron [staircase] is spiraling right out of the floor and up to the second story. There's also a [window] with a [diamond]-shaped panel in the middle, illuminating the [table and chairs]. To the west there's a [door] leading [outside].
Here's hoping I don't have to use this [bathroom] anytime soon. I think someone ran [out] of Scrubbing Bubbles a long time ago. Streaks and lines on the ceramic tiled [walls] are good evidence of futile efforts to clean the grime and mold off with a washcloth... many years ago. The floor is probably linoleum, but let's not think about the floor too much. There's also normal [bathroom] stuff in here like a [sink], a [shower], a [mirror], etc.
An overgrown garden surrounded by a high, [whitewashed] [wall]. Looking up to the gray [sky], I see that the [wall] seems to block the mist somehow. The [sky] is clear, albeit gray, directly above me. There's a [sundial] that casts no shadow, and the [hedges] need to be clipped badly. To the east is the [house]. To the north there's an interesting sort of [shack]. It's built into the [wall] and seems to slope underneath it. I think it's a [boathouse]!
I see a [slave driver] and a [boat] here, and I ain't got much choice left.
Late at night this [subway] platform is eerily quiet. To the north a [train] has just pulled up and opened its doors.
You are standing in the middle of the car. There are nine other people in the car with you. One of them, a dark-haired [woman] is remarkably beautiful.
Come now, as light thickens, and the crow makes wing to rookery wood. [Tempests] rise as great bloody [hands], to tear down our safe, homely lives. Come with me on dragon wings to wicked woods, where night's black agents to [their] preys do rouse." [Dracula] - Prince of [Darkness] by Paul Johnson. www.wolfman.co.uk. Release 3 / Serial number 051012 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11
An open grass field covered in a low [mist]. The field is surrounded by a dark and gloomy [wood]. High [above] you shines a blood red [moon].
All around you are the stone [ruins] of Whitby [Abbey]. A noble ruin of immense size. Beautiful, once. All that is left are the great, [outer] [walls]. Made from immense black [stones] now eroded away by centuries of [sea] winds. From high up, [windows] empty of glass watch your progress far [below]. To the NORTH, beyond the [Abbey's] stone wall, you can hear the [sea] crashing against the [rocks] far [below].
You are on a small winding path. The [Abbey] is EAST. To the WEST is the [graveyard].
A [bench] is positioned to give a view of the [harbour] and the [bay]. The [church] is to your NORTH. To the EAST a path leads back up to the Abbey. [Stone steps] lead DOWN to the [harbour].
You are in a [graveyard] high up over the [town].
Steep stone [steps] lead DOWN to the back streets of [Whitby], or UP to into the graveyard.
A narrow back street runs NORTH and SOUTH. Steep [stone steps] lead UP towards the [church].
As you step along the narrow street, You hear a long, deep growl. There before you sits a foul thing. A great black [beast].
This [cobbled] street slopes downwards towards the WEST, becoming narrower as the [buildings] seems to close in around you. A [sign] on the wall reads.
A simple [altar] lies at the head of [two] rows of dark wood [pews]. Next to the [altar] is a [gold lectern], on which sits a [Bible]. A room leads off to the WEST. The graveyard is back SOUTH.
You hear the unmistakable sound of The [Professor] close behind you, he seems satisfied by your continued living that nothing's likely to burn, decapitate or eat him upon stepping through the door. You're happy to help.
You are in [Dracula's] private library. A beautiful, and vaguelly unnerving, balance of gothic and cosy prevails throughout the rooms design.

Release 3 \ SN-130521 \ I7-6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N)  Type Help if you're confused or About if you're curious. Science Station Alpha Aha! Your months of Grade Seventy Dream Training have paid off ... this dream-chamber is none other than Science Station Alpha, on the surface of a distant moon of the [Visceron] System. Here is where you and the [Professor] first crossed rays, and where his studies of sleep-states led him to develop the "perfect" preservative level of slumber: the Level IX Subconscious Psychic Comatose Preservation State.
This is none other than [Science Station Alpha], on the [surface] of a distant [moon] of the Visceron System. You can see other [chambers] to the north, east, and west.
As far as the eye can see, corridors stretch off in a north-south and east-west grid. At every intersection, like the one you're standing at, there are cubicle entryways in the four diagonal directions. People are rushing past, back and forth, in and out. A [jester] follows you mercilessly, singing and dancing. A worker rushes up to you and gives you an envelope. "These pornographic pictures of the Queen Mum are needed in sector 1465 right now! Take it west, then south, then southeast!"
The [jester] sings, "Hey nonny nonny, with a hey and a ho."
The [jester] lifts one leg, spins around on one foot, and falls over.
A [worker] rushes up to you and wrests the [envelope] from your hands and replaces it with another one. "You're too late with that package, gopher!" he yells. This preprint of biological research is needed in sector 1812 right now! Take it southeast, then east, then southwest!" The [jester] tells a bawdy joke with a punchline in Elizabethan English.
It's early morning, and it's quite obvious to tell. Your wife, [Jane Doe], is fixing lunches for your [two] kids. To head [out], you should go east.
You are in a small chamber, approximately [three] feet wide and [six] tall, allowing you barely any room. Oddly, the [walls] are a bright blue color, while the [ceiling] is a colorful shade of orange and the floor a sunny yellow.
Nothing surrounds you. The [virtual space] is unbounded and absolutely blank, except for your new [archetype].
You are standing somewhere in a [vast field of barley]. The [barley] stretches as far as you can see in every direction under a [hot summer sky].
The [ice] of the Cocytean piedmont is pitted and rotten, riddled with moulins of befouled meltwater. For the most part the [caves] are unstable, but they don't [tend] to change too much over winter. This one is large enough to serve as temporary depot, but small and twisty enough to keep it hidden.
Although the ideal crew of a 'gin of this class is [three], the Quagga has been rigged to allow it to be crewed one-handed, though you'd break your back jumping between [helm and firebox] at anything faster than a trot. The cut-down controls - essentially just the [gearshaft and helm] - will not exactly allow you to fight any cavalry actions, but fortunately Hell is short on armour regiments.
You're in a [bedroom]. [Everything] about this room seems normal on one level and yet oddly different on another. A quick scan around the room makes you ill-at-ease, as if you don't belong here. Or perhaps the room itself doesn't belong anywhere. A [dresser] complete with a [mirror] lies off to one side, against a white, featureless [wall]. A [door] is off to the west while to the south, through a [doorway], you can see what must be a small bathroom.
You are in the middle of a [living room]. The [room] is sparsely furnished in modern, chrome and black [acrylic furniture]. On one of the [walls] is a [curtain] with an oddly familiar [patterned] [fabric] draped from floor to [ceiling]. Open [doorways] lead off to the west and south, while a [door] lies off to the east.
You're in the [dining room], complete with a [dining room table and chairs]. There are three [doorways] here--one to the north, one to the west and another to the east.
You're standing in the [kitchen] of the apartment with a doorway to the east. [Cabinets] line the [wall], broken by a large [refrigerator] beside a [range]. The place looks sort of like your own apartment, but the floor is a wild circular pattern and the [ceiling] is a light blue.
You are in the [entry] way to an [apartment]. The [walls] are white, the floor a neutral beige. To the west lies a humming and buzzing corridor which dissolves into a thick, foggy mist. Off to the east is the living room.
A white [mist] envelops you in mid-stride. The floor beneath you drops away and you feel as though you are falling through space.
You are in a [laboratory], buried deep within the Research Zone. Parts of the [lab] seem oddly familiar, though most of it looks different from what you remember. The [walls] are made of a strange translucent material which seem to generate their own light from within. A [black], acrylic [shell] which occupies the center of the room lies open. Passageways, like misty tunnels, spoke off the octagonal room in all eight compass points.
You are standing on the sidewalk, directly [outside] the entrance to a large, ancient building. Above the entrance is a sign which says, "Science Art [Museum]." The sidewalk continues off to the south along the west edge of the building.
You are standing by the entrance of the Science Art [Museum]. The hall is tremendous in proportion, stretching out in all directions. The [ceiling] towers high overhead. To the west is the exit.
You are in the southwest corner of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you is a [small plaque].
You are in the south area of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you, to the south, stands a huge [chamber] made of [steel] plates riveted together. An oversized [door] is visible in the structure. Beside the [door] is a small [dial]. A [drain] is in the floor by your feet.
You're in the [center] of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you stands a [pedestal] on which is mounted a guide to some of the [museum's] exhibits.
You are in the northern area of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you, behind [glass] is a [laser exhibit]. Sitting on a little [pedestal] is a [computer terminal].
You are in the northeast corner of the Science Art [Museum].
You are in a northwest corner of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you is a [small] but interesting [exhibit].
You're at a [corner] on the [sidewalk] which travels around the Museum. The [sidewalk] goes off to the north and east. To the south and west are beautiful [lawns] of manicured [grass]. The [grass] looks a little dry.
You are in the east side of the Science Art [Museum]. Before you, sitting along the [wall], is a [long table]. The [table] houses two exhibits: a [generator] and a [waterwheel]. The [generator] sits on the northern end of the [table] and is connected to the [waterwheel] by a [leather belt].
You are in the southeast corner of the Science Art [Museum].
Before you stretches a [prairie] of soft, [blue] grass that melts into the horizon. Off to the east towers a huge pyramid made of glistening crystal, while off to the southwest the trail disappears into a dense, white mist.
You stand before a gleaming [pyramid] that rises up and blocks out the sun. As you shift your head from side to side, sunlight is refracted and reflected in a prismatic display. A long, blue prairie stretches out to the west while a barely-worn path starts up, leading off to the east.
You are inside the crystal [pyramid], standing before a crystal [pedestal]. The sunlight streams in through the [walls]. [Each] wall has hundreds of thousands of [facets, and each facet] creates dazzling kaleidoscopic effects and reflects countless images of you. The reflectivity of the [walls and facets] begin to disorient you as the images seem to have a life of their own.
You stand in one of the many beige, featureless [corridors] of the Physics building. The [hall] continues west, and reaches its eastern terminus here, at the [door] to Mom and Dad's [lab].
The classrooms at EGHHS can't really be distinguished by their physical features alone. This room is (was?) an English classroom. All the typical features of a classroom were present: neatly arranged [desk]-chairs facing a whiteboard and the [teacher's] [desk], oppressed-looking [students], a dictatorial [teacher], etc. The [windows] faced to the school's courtyard.
Welcome to Park Place, East Grove Hills, Minnesota. Home of me. And a few other people I knew, but I think they're dead now. Not that it makes much of a difference. I didn't really know them. Multicolored [houses] with perfectly manicured [lawns] and tall, verdant trees line the gently winding street. The intersection with Pines Avenue is to the north.
Pines Avenue is the main road through this corner of the suburbs, with sidewalks and a median. [Townhouses] flank the sides of the road, filled with the typical suburbanite stock. The way to the park is through Dalton Street, which is east of here.
You are on the cliff edge, the traditional penultimate destination of the love-lorn. You have in your hand a [bottle of whiskey], and spread at your feet is an open [diary]. Your [sandals] lie beside you, as does a faded [bandana] that you've used to tie up your flowing scarlet locks. You see the world through intermittant tears, and you are certain that love will no longer be yours.
You are standing [outside]. You can enter the [house] through the [cat flap] to the east.
You are standing in the living room. The front [door] is west, the kitchen is to the east, and the hallway leads south.
The hallway continues to the south. To the east is a closed [door]. To the west is a [closet]. The living room is north.
You are standing in the [closet].
The hallway continues to the north. To the east is a [bedroom]. To the west is a closed [door].
You are standing in the [bedroom]. The hallway is to the west.
All [things] are difficult before they are easy. (Dr. Thomas Fuller)
This is a chinese restaurant. You know it's a chinese restaurant, because the word 'Restaurant' is written in huge flashing blue letters on one of the [walls], in chinese. You're rather surprised that you can read it, since you don't know chinese. Aside from the writing on the [wall], there's nothing else in the room apart from you and a [chimney].
You're not sure how you got to a [big] field of [mud from] a chinese restaurant, but you did. Accept it. Move on. The sun sure is hot.
We moved there shortly after [Chris] got evicted from his tiny [apartment] in the [City]. That new [place] was not only filled with a despicable amount of [trees], but also unbearably hot and humid. Many untold [dangers] lurked among the [lush vegetation], as I was soon to find [out].
Fork You stand at a point of decision on a [road] which makes a wide fork to the northeast and southeast, circling the base of the Lonely [Mountain], which looms high overhead to the east. A very long and winding [road] starts here and stretches out of sight to the west through low, smoky [hills].
Long [Road] You are walking along the [road]. It wends its way through low [hills], sparse [forests], and occasional subsistence [farms]. To the west, things seem [lighter] and more pleasant. To the east they seem oppressive and dark. A worn [sign] sits beside the [road] here. The deserted village is to the east.
Dusty [Trail] The [trail] here turns dry and dusty. To the northwest is the fork leading to the Long [Road], and the [trail] continues to the southeast.
Loop The [trail] makes a hairpin turn here, swinging out to the northwest and northeast, where it enters a small village. Low, smoky [hills] stretch out to the west and south.
Deserted Village This is the [castle's] village.
[Mountain] [Trail] This spot halfway up the Lonely [Mountain] is desolate of vegetation. Short, stunted [trees] with [branches] empty surround you and the air is heavy and smoke-filled.
Lonely [Mountain] This is the top of the Lonely [Mountain]. In olden days, mariners had named it Signal [Mountain], for its glistening [peak] reflected the pale moonlight, providing an unmistakable landmark on unclouded nights. The bald [mountain] [face] is made of a shining substance whose nature is unknown to you. Looking to the west, low [hills] stretch to the horizon, and small pieces of the Long [Road] can be seen winding their way to distant lands. To the east, far away, can be seen a great [castle] at the edge of the Sea. Three [turrets] it has; two, old and still majestic, lie on either side of a third, cold, black as night and squat as a toad. An evil smoke seems to emanate from this [tower], shrouding the others in a darkening fog. A small [mountain] [trail] leaves the [peak] and descends to the south into a small village far below.
Village Outskirts You are on a [road] which enters a small village to the southwest and comes to a fork to the northeast.
The sun starts to set behind the Lonely [Mountain] in the west. You are beginning to feel faint from lack of water.
You are beginning to tire and the [spells] you've memorized are becoming confused.
Eastern Fork You are at a fork in the [road] where [paths] to the northwest and southwest girdle the base of the Lonely [Mountain] and a smaller [path] winds its way to the east.
The darkened [sky] is now full of bright [stars]. It is night.
Western [Road] You are on an east-west [road], which wends its way through the dark, rolling [hills] of this land.
Outside [Gate] You are outside the western [entrance] to the [castle].
The [stars] shine down on you from a clear, dark [sky].
[Trail] Head You are on the northeast side of the Lonely [Mountain], walking a narrow [path] through rolling [hills]. On one side of the [path] is a [sign] and behind that, to the northeast, a winding [path] through the thick [undergrowth]. The [trail] continues to the southeast.
[Trail] The [trail] turns a corner here, bending out of sight to the southeast and southwest.
Outside of [Shack] You are south of an old wooden [shack], apparently deserted.
The [trail] here turns dry and dusty.
You are on the northeast side of the Lonely [Mountain], walking a narrow [path] through rolling [hills].
This spot halfway up the Lonely [Mountain] is desolate of vegetation.
This is the top of the Lonely [Mountain].
The [trail] makes a hairpin turn here, swinging out to the northwest and northeast, where it enters a small village.
The weather has rapidly deteriorated, [raindrops] bouncing [off] the slanted [marquee] onto the [pavement]. Darkness comes early in the winter months, but fortunately the [street lamps] keep this area of the city well illuminated. The prospect of the [warm lobby] of the [[eight]-sc]reen [cinema] to the west becomes more attractive with [each] passing second.
In the crowd. The kid has been taken hostage by a [madman]. "Damn it, this kind of thing shouldn't happen."
The [house] stands in a large undeveloped area on the southwestern side of the Mississippi, surrounded by thick [vegetation]. The [building] itself is quite recent (no more than 20 years old, from the looks of it). The [house] seems utterly abandoned, and the [trees] hide it from prying eyes. To the east lies the front entrance, whereas to the north you can examine the rear of the [house].
A [window faces] the newly paved road leading to the [house]. A steel-[clad door] leads inside. You can enter to the north or go back west.
The [entrance] of the [house] looks at first glance as normal as could be, but the steel plates reinforcing the front [door] belie that perception. There's a [doorbell] on the [wall].
From here you can go [back] south to the front of the [house].
At the rear of the [house] you see [two] upper story [windows], which should afford a nice view of the [Mississippi]. From the north, you can hear the Big [River] flowing nearby.
That's where you are, and you are [holding] a [thing].
Lost [Battlefield] In all directions the land is a waste. [Craters], [bones, flesh  smoke] litter the entire [landscape] while [ashen clouds] form dark and foreboding shapes in an angry red [sky]. The earth trembles from dislocated tectonic plates and the atmosphere is quickly becoming unbreathable and unlivable. A smoking [forest] can be seen to the west, a large steel-gray [city] is [burning] to the north, and the edge of an enormous smoldering [crater] lies to the east.
[Edge] Of [City] Standing on the southern [edge] of the largest [city] on the planet, you survey the results of thermonuclear war. Although some structures remain standing, there is nothing left but the plasteel infrastructures of once proud and magnificent towers and buildings. A dense fog of death parades around the [city] in dust-devil frenzy. The stench of burnt [flesh] and fused materials is overwhelming and guards the [city] far better than its previous occupants ever could.
Deep [Crater] High radiation and wisps of [smoke] dance within the confines of this enormous catastrophe. You're at the center of a [crater] created by a thermonuclear weapon, two hundred meters below the natural landscape and half a klick east of the [battlefield]. Through the haze, a smaller [crevice] appears on the northeast edge of the [crater].
[Riverbed] In the bottom of the [riverbed], you find the boiled and battered [remains of both] animal and plant life. Although the [river] once flowed from north to south, only the north seems passable. On either side, one to the southwest and one to the east, you see small ledges to carry you up and out of the [river] bottom.
[Smoking Forest] Overlapping reality with [memory], this was recently a beautiful and lush ecosystem of vibrant [foliage] and small wildlife. , the large [forest] west of the city is now a [field] of burning [stumps and smoking brush]. The [battlefield] can be seen to the east and a burning [field] opens to the west.
Scorched [Fields] The vast farmland west of the city and forest is completely blackened by plasma-fire and thermonuclear explosions. The radiation is so bad here that no human, animal, or plant life could have survived. The [remains] of a forest can be seen to the east and the [remains] of the spaceport can be seen to the northwest. Auto Repair says, "Complete system failure imminent."
The inside of a rusty shipping [container] that has surely made a number of transatlantic journeys. It is lit by a single [light bulb] swinging from the ceiling above a [desk]. There is just the barest hint of [light] peeking through a [hole] high in the [door], on what you assume is the front of the [container], and there might be something on the [left] wall, but you can't see for the glare from the [light bulb].
A practically-abandoned port, with the [sea] off to the west and a street leading into a town to the east.
A busy port street bustling with people who look as worn-[out] as the cobblestones. To the north is a fishmonger, to the south a post office. The docks are [back] west. Further down the street, to the northeast is a pub, and a travel agent's to the southeast.
Like your idea of a traditional English pub, if you had incredibly low standards. It's got more than its fair share of damage: broken [stools], burned table [tops], and what looks to be a large [blood stain] on the floor [right] in front of the [bathroom].
Each shop on this street seems to be smaller than the last, and the [travel] agency is no exception, being nothing but a [desk] and a [rack of travel brochures].
A tiny post office containing nothing but a wall of post office [boxes] and a small counter. You wonder when the last time it was cleaned; every surface is coated in [sea salt, cobwebs], or [both].
A tiny [fishmonger's] shop sits just off the main dock street. The [blackboard] listing today's [prices] has been erased so many times you can hardly read it.
The room has a very dark feeling too it. [Everything] in here is grey and old. There is a long [counter top] with a [sink] that has a [cupboard] underneath it. At the far end of the [counter] is a [washing machine] and beside it, a [filing cabinet]. High on the back wall is a [fusebox]. A [big rusty door] blocks your only escape to the west.
This is the north side of the room. A [heavy steel door] (presumably the exit) is set into the north [wall], and numerous [heavy wooden boards] have been nailed across it. Seems like someone didn't want you leaving this place.
This is the west side of the room. A [plain white door] (which is currently closed) leads west. Next to the [door], a [red, glass-fronted] [box] is mounted on the [wall].
This is the south side of the room. An uncomfortable-looking [cot] is pushed up against the [wall], underneath a [small barred] [window].
My plywood furnishings are completely ruined and more importantly, the poor [chap] can be seen, trapped beneath a [beam].
The room is dusty and dank, a musty smell prevails throughout the room. It seems as though it has been a very long time since anyone entered this room. Some [rotted wood] lies along the walls, possibly the remains of a few [bookshelves]
The chief feature of this area is that you don't recognize it and have no idea where you are. A [door] is west, and you can go east.
You can go west, and a [door] is east.
Wary also very hot. [She] likes sunburn, you do not. Autumn's west and Spring is east.
Air is chilly, [she] don't like. [She] wants to sleep, you'd rather hike. Winter's west and Summer's east.
Short of breath and long on sneezes, itchy eyes and wimpering wheezes. [She] would like to roll in hay. Summer's west, and Winter's east.
The [garden] is naturally fairly empty at this time of the year, although the [variegated] [ivy] among the [shrubbery] gives it a [little] colour. To the [right] is a [wooden fence] too [high] to see [over]. To the [left, beyond] a row of [low posts], is your [neighbour's] [garden, brightened], unlike yours, by a [red camellia]. The [garden path] runs the ten [yards] between the [conservatory] and the [rear gate].
It has [snowed]! It's less than half an inch, [over] the [lawn] and it's melting on the [path]. The [roof] of the [shed] is [white]. You can see the [beds] to the [left] of the [lawn], mostly [covered], and the [little tree] standing up from the [hard white area] to the [right].
There seem to be [lots of things] coming up in the [long border] on your [left], which is [next] to the [neighbour's] [fence]. You can also see the [lawn], the [bricked] [area] you could call a "[terrace]", the [path] separating the [two] and the [shed].
From here you have a view of your [neighbours'] [garden] on your [left] and part of the [street beyond], and of your [garden] as far as the [shed]. That [area], measuring less than twenty feet by forty, includes the [two flower beds], the [lawn], the [path], the "[shack] on the [back]" and the "[terrace]". Some [bits of litter] seem to have come in somehow.
The [sun] is approaching its mid-[day] peak, and saturating the [garden] with colour. The dark figure of the [shed] at the end, with the [garden next door] and the [street] visible to the [left], the [bright-green lawn] and all the [plants] in the [flower beds], and even the [reddish] [brick area], all seem unusually vivid.
A very [bright day], adding extra colour to all you can see; from the northern [fence] (which [wastes] the [sun] it receives), [left] to the [brick area], the [path], the [shed], the [lawn, herb bed and long border], and a view of your [neighbours'] [garden] and part of the [street beyond], around to your [house and conservatory].
The early [afternoon sun] beats against the [high wooden fence] to the north. To the south, [beyond] a [low fence], is your [neighbour's] [garden], full of [hanging baskets and honeysuckle]. The [garden path] runs the ten [yards] between the [conservatory] and the [rear gate], separating the [lawn and flower beds] to the [left] and the [terrace] to the [right].
This room is full of silence. Freshly disturbed [dust] hangs upon the air. There are [patterns of pressure] upon the [carpet], suggesting there are [spaces] where once there weren't. The [walls] are bare, but for the occasional pictureless [hook]. There is a [wardrobe] here, a [chest of drawers] and a [skeleton of shelves] against the far wall.
Winter light lies in anaemic strips upon the floor from where it has fallen through the glass [panels] in the front [door]. There is an [awful painting] hanging on the wall. The murmuring voices are more of a babble now; too many over-lapping conversations create an alien, baboonish gibberish.
The extensive living / dining area was one of the features that drew you all to this house when you were looking for places to rent. That and - despite the fact none of you have been able to bring [yourself] to do anything as prosaic as cleaning for days - the fact it's not an abject shit hole like most of the places on offer when you were doing the rounds.
The kitchen is surprisingly spacious for a rented house. It has faux-granite [counter] tops and matching [tiling], and fitted [cupboards] in shades of coffee and cream.
The back garden is really little more than a [lawn]-gone-wild and a weedy [patio]. The [sky] is a cool grey curtain backlit by the weak [sun]. The chill air bites at your skin.
You are standing by your [bed]. There is a room to the east.
You are in the room used for cooking and food preparation. Something smells good coming from the [stove].
The corridor is lined with lights against the wall. The [elevator door] is closed.
You are in a [small bedroom]. Along the [walls] are various [paintings]. Resting on the [thick carpet] is a [nightstand]. A [strip of wallpaper] near the [ceiling] adds a dark red accent to the otherwise white [bedroom]. In the north [wall] of the room is a [large window]. A [mirror] hangs by the [window]. To the west is a [door] that leads to a [closet] of some sort. Visibility through the [doorway] to the south is blocked by [strings of beads] hanging down, but it probably leads to the rest of the house.
This imposing room used to underline the theater's former glory, heaps of equipment lying all over the place in demonstratively unkempt heaps. As times grew harder, however, it has been stripped of its former abundance: now it only possesses a [chair], a [wall safe] and the [mainframe] set up the last night.
This is the cultural center of apartment F209. Its true symbolic magnificence is once again belied by its current squalid nature. You wonder for a while how anyone could actually live in a place like this, until you remember that you pay the rent here. The endless white of the undecorated [walls] is interrupted only by a hallway to the south, the kitchen to the east, and the front [door] to the north.
A formless void. Empty. Dull. There appears to be no way [out]. Still, better than Detroit.
This small alley is being basically ignored by the large parade to the west. A carnival of some kind stretches [out] to the east.
You're standing west of a small, eldritch-looking white house purporting to be a [bakery]. A huge parade of partygoers continues to stream by to the west, while the entrance to the [bakery] yawns open to the east.
"Oh, let's see.. it's bad up here. There's the [console], with the [computer screen] on. The engineer, [McThwaite].. -"
"Oh, let's see. The attack was tough, it's bad... ...[console], with the [computer screen] on.
This is the centre of a small village made of concrete. The square extends to the east where you can make [out] some buildings. Surprisingly, someone seems to have planted an [oak tree] here.
This is Toadstool Street, a long east/west road which connects the village square with the rest of town. Many village squares are, of course, in the centre of any village, but the villages in Fairyland are laid [out] in such a way that the square is usually on the western side of the town. To the north is a pub.
The inn, a welcoming sight for travellers, is a cozy one indeed. It is here where you can get a bed for the night upstairs and a good hot meal inside your body. The innkeeper even irons your clothes for free, although he doesn't actually use an iron since they can burn fairies. A door leads south back onto the market square and there is a [sign] nailed to a wall. A dor leading west seems to have a smell of animals lingering about it.
The local village pub is warm and cozy, with a crackling fire along the north wall. Several tables and chairs stand in small groups [each] seating about six patrons who are drinking and laughing. A door to the south leads back onto Toadstool Street.
The local church along with its graveyard marks the dead centre of town. Being Tuesday, you have no reason to talk to God (or any other religious spirit for that matter). [Gravestones] mark the resting places of those who have passed on, and their names can still be read. To the north, you can hear the neighing of the horses beside the local inn.
Visitors used to sit on the [bench] here to contemplate their mortality. Apparently the reminders of their mortality have become all too great. A [marble door] leads inside.
Cords seething with power radiate in all directions. At their [center] is a pulsing [node] that commands whatever lies at the other end. The [node] itself you have commanded to bring this being here, and you will continue to command it just a little longer. The Soul is to the east, to the northeast is the Intellect, and to the southeast is the Id.
Thoughts coalesce into [complex structures] here. You have spent much time here already, talking to it, trying to understand how it could do what it did. The Soul is to the south, the Motive Nexus is to the southwest, and the Sensory Nexus is to the southeast.
The [baser desires] of this being are jumbled about like so much [trash]. The Soul is to the north, the Motive Nexus is to the northwest, and the Sensory nexus is to the northeast.
Two [windows] are shuttered with [orange, veined membranes]; to either side of them there is sound, beneath them, smell, taste, and touch. The Soul is to the west, to the northwest is the Intellect, and to the southwest is the Id.
You're [outside]. To the west, the sky is blue and cornfields blanket the land. To the east, stormclouds, lightning, thunder, and rain cover barren land. Running east-west on a black surface are yellow dashes. You hear chirps and peeps to the west, but no other life seems to be nearby.
You're on the [stairway] from Hell. Directions should be clear to all beings finding themselves in this most precarious of locations. In the surrounding din of flames and crashes you hear a Led Zepplin song playing backwards.
This is the exit from hell. Behind you is a [gate] of flames, barring your return, for the moment. Before you and toward the light is a long stairway. Lucifer's voice carries behind you, "Go forthwith my angel. You shall return soon. Your fate has already been cast."
Your room. Very clean. Almost conveniently so. Anyway, either because you're such a neat-freak, or because it's [four] in the morning and too dark to see anything else, there are only a few things visible here, illuminated by the [television's] glow. The [bed], for one. Not that you'll be needing it until you beat this game. You know you should be getting rest for the history exam, but whatever. A few more minutes won't hurt.
You are standing out in the cold before an old [farmhouse]. The front [door] lies to your north.
The servants know it is death to enter your den, your sanctuary from public life. Two [braziers] cast warmth and just enough mellow light to see the [tapestries] that line three of the four walls. A [small], intricately decorated [cabinet] huddles in the far corner, while a heavy [curtain] obscures the doorway to the south. Faint [wisps of magic] linger in the air.
The parlour, which is the central room of your three-room apartment, is less your own than you'd like: one of [Prince] Harold's [knights], [Sir Charles], has installed [himself] on the [leather couch]. The walls are adorned by three [paintings] and a huge [mirror], none of them to your taste. Luckily, there are three routes of escape: your den lies to the north, your bedroom to the east, and the rest of the castle can be reached by the staircase to the west.
You sleep in this luxuriously furnished room, complete with a huge [four]-poster [bed] and a [mahogany beauty table]. As your pregnancy progressed, you came to spend more and more time here, simply exhausted from moving up and down a few staircases. A [portrait] of your [mother] graces the wall where you can look at it from the [bed], while a large [golden cage] containing your [pixie] dangles from the [ceiling].
This first-floor room is almost uncomfortably warm and well-lit. The [bed] sits against the east [wall, and curtains] cover the [windows] to the south. A [calendar] hangs from a [hook] on one [wall], and the exit is to the north.
A [ladder] hangs down from a dark [square hole] in the high [ceiling] of this unadorned corridor. Identical doors to the north, east and south lead to various rooms. To the west, [hanging] over the stairs, a bright electric [lamp] provides illumination.
You are in the western half of a plain whitewashed east-west corridor [lit] by a [lamp hanging] next to the stairs, which lead down to the ground floor. The carpeted wooden floor creaks annoyingly under your feet.
This spacious [room] is comfortably if sparsely furnished. A plush [sofa and two] matching [armchairs] are arranged around a low [wooden] tea-[table]. [Curtains] hang over the long [windows] on the south [wall], keeping the warmth from the old electric [fireplace] in; a [clock] hangs over the [mantelpiece]. The overall effect might even be cosy, were it not for the stark white [glare] of the [unshielded] [bulb] dangling from the [ceiling].
A large [bookcase] occupies the north [wall] of this brightly lit room. Next to the dull green [curtains] of the [window] stands a [wooden desk].
This simple white-tiled [bathroom] is lit by a [fluorescent] [ceiling lamp]. [Streaks of mould] cover the [ceiling] and the upper parts of the [walls], but fortunately the [tub, toilet and sink] are free of [fungus].
You're at the southern [shore] of a wide [river] which runs east to west as far as you can see. A stretch of fine [sand] here makes for a scenic, if narrow, [beach]. A wooden [dock] extends [out] several feet from the [beach] into the [water]. Across the [river], a hundred yards or so to the north, you can just make [out] the far [shore]. To the south is the road you drove in on, your [delivery van] parked off on the shoulder.
You're in the [lower hallway] of the house between the living room to the west and the kitchen to the east. The basement door is open to the south. All you need to do is go down. [Fido] growls at the [dead body].
This is the [kitchen]. [Cupboards] line the [walls] and the normal appliances fit sungly in between. The lower hallway is to the west.
Your [house] is to the north. The steet goes east and west.
A [chain-link] [fence] is to the east. The street goes north and south.
The room is full of all sorts of [equipment] which might make sense if you had read your [textbooks]. Or paid attention in class. Or turned up. A closed [door] to the south leads into the main hallway.
You have hidden [yourself] in a [trunk], which is currently closed. You can peek through the [keyhole], if you so desire.
Sterile [white walls] enclose a [small] laboratory packed with [workstations and specimen containers]. [Red lights] flare on and off, while a [klaxon] blares. [Blast doors] to the west lead to the last of a set of [security] checkpoints before one enters the lab, while the north [door] opens into the [large-specimen] containment wing.
Your own little [cell]. The [walls] are [paneled wood] below waist-height, expensive [wallpaper] above. All around, in glazed [pots, houseplants]. A [mirror] hangs on the wall before you.
Why I awoke in a closet after passing [out] escapes me. I'd rather not know anyways. There are doors in all directions.
A very tiny bathroom with only a [toilet].
I'm [outside] the garden [mart], in between that old [cadillac] and the [window] where I work. Just walking along, east to west, nothing to see here. I'm real glad I'm all alone, all by [myself].
I am in my [car], which is not bad. But my [car] that I am in is in [freefall], which is a kind of bad. Did I mention that I am an object currently contained within this container that is my [car], which is in [freefall]? Not much [left] for me to do at this point, and not more than a moment [left] to do it.
Picking a number at random, you tell The Guv' that you choose cell number "thirteen thousand, five hundred and fifty-[four]" to spend the night in.
Kitchen (on the [chair]) On the [table] are a [milk carton], a [plate of brownies], your [glass, and Sam's] [cup].
On the [table] are a [milk carton], a [plate of brownies], your [glass, and Sam's] [cup].
The hiker [parking] [area] is where people generally leave their [cars] while exploring the nearby [trail] system in the national [park], but this morning it's devoid of [vehicles]. A [grassy hill], recently [mown], lines the western edge of the [parking] [lot], while a [forest] abuts it to the east. From the [parking] [lot] there are two [roads]: one departing north, toward the [park exit], and one leading south toward the [campground] just [under] half a mile away. A [trail] enters the [woods] to the east, quickly disappearing amongst the [hemlocks].
A standard NPS [trail sign] indicates that the Lower Mt. Cammerer [trail] begins here, leaving the [pavement] and entering the [woods] to the northeast.
You're standing at the junction of two [trails], one running northwest-southeast, the other running northeast-southwest. At the north corner of the junction, two signs are nailed to a single post indicating where [each] trail leads.
Tom's [Creek] flows across the [path] here, beneath a [sturdy log [footbridg]]e. The [path] continues on the other side of the [bridge], to the northeast.
You're standing at a bend in the [trail] on the crest of Sutton Ridge. The [trail] turns from south to east here, and a spur [trail] scrambles through the [arbutus and galax] to the southeast.
Riding Fork Creek cascades down a series of mossy [dark] gray rocks here. Whenever you're ready to move on, the [path] continues on the other side of the creek, to the north.
The AT climbs from east to west here, ascending toward the [peak] of the [mountain] and the fire tower. The [Lower] Mt. Cammerer [trail], from which you accessed the AT, descends out of the junction to the northwest.
The AT runs from northeast to southwest here, continuing on toward Low Gap. A [trail sign] announces that the Mt. Cammerer fire tower is located just over half a mile to the north.
The [fire tower] has a commanding [view] of the surrounding [mountains]. You can enter the [tower] or simply return [back] the way you came. The [trail] departs to the southwest.
You stand in the center of [Low Gap], where two [trails] intersect. For the Appalachian Trail, this is a [low] spot, and the trail climbs [both] to the southwest, toward [Cosby Knob], and northeast, [back] toward the fire tower. Conversely, this is high spot on the [Low Gap] trail, which descends into Walnut Bottoms to the southeast and, to the northwest, toward home.
A sign [post] stands in the northeast corner of the clearing, [bearing] two [signs]. The [uppermost] sign reads:
You stand on the [pavement] at the Low Gap [trailhead], beside a [locked gate]. The [road] travels through the campground here, entering from the south and curving northwest, past the Lower Mt. Cammerer [trailhead] and on to the parking area where your ride will be expecting you.
Outside you can hear the wind grinding against the weak walls of the [shack]. The only light in the one room [shack] comes from a waxy [window]. There is a simple [dresser] missing one leg in the corner; on top of the [dresser] is a grey glass [fish bowl].
This simple chamber is little more than [four] off-white walls and a hardwood floor. The door you entered through is in the south wall, and [two windows] in the north wall let some [light] into the room. A scarred, [wooden chair] sits in the center of the room. A [guitar] rests on the [chair], laid flat on the seat, with its [neck] hanging [out] in space. An [amplifier] sits on the floor next to the [chair].
They say that home is where you hang your [hat]. This is the place you call home, but if you let go of your [hat] off it'd probably try to escape. Your one-room [office], leased from [above] a taco joint, has heat (in the summer), air (if you open the [window]), and hot and cold running rodents. The latter occasionally emit squeals, which herald opportunity for boredom relief as they scurry from the heavily cracked walls to a hole under the [Wood-Esque](TM) [desk]. They also provide the random excremental smells, or at least you hope so. It's not all bad, though... you [tend] to collect [gizmos] that you try to fix up in your spare time. What's more, when the [phone] rings, you sometimes get a case, and have a good reason to leave. If you were to do so, it'd be to the east onto the street.
Your office street in [Sunnyvale] is in the middle of an industrial row. [Two drunks] sit on the curb watching the [mold] grow. There's sure to be bits of your [television] here-- [Ralph] couldn't have thrown it far-- but it blends in with the rest of the [debris] on the street.
Through the [iron balconies above], a small bit of light filters into the dank [alley]. The east end is blocked off, but the west end opens to the main road.
This is a rather small [office], as befits your assistant assistant managerial position. The chief features are the [desk] which is too small for good use, yet just large enough to take up too much space, and the [window] which you can never quite get to stay closed. The [open door] leads west to the hallway.
Not much to say, really. Your [office] is to the east and the stairs are to the south. There is a closet to the north.
The icy salt water stings your nostrils as you thrash about madly. Unless you get [out] of here quick, you've got seconds to live.
The [docks] are deserted at this time of night. A chill breeze carries the salty air from the [bay] to the west. To the south, a [trail of water] leads between a pair of [warehouses], and a homeopathic clinic to the north.
The alley dead-ends here in a [corrugated] [metal wall]
This is very like the [room] you were assigned for this year's exam season. There are dozens of them in the Administration Centre's residential block, all more or less identical. But it cannot be your [room], because all of your stuff is gone, and the [room] looks like it did when you first moved in. It's clean, tidy, and almost completely empty, just with basic furnishings: [desk, chair, bed and washbasin]. There's a [window] in the north [wall] and a [door] leads south.
This is the main [entrance] to the sprawling Administration Centre. [Large doors] to the south would lead to the [driveway] and surrounding parkland, but you cannot see anything through the [windows] in the south [wall]. A [grand staircase] leads upwards. [Doors] lead east and west to the [wings] of the main building, while a smaller exit leads north to the [quadrangle]. There is a [green door] in the northwest corner of the [room]. There's a [mural] on the western [wall], and a [portrait] and a [mirror] on the eastern [wall].
The [quadrangle] is completely surrounded by [Administration] [Centre buildings]. It's a large, square [outdoor] space with well-[tended] [lawns and flowerbeds and paths] leading in all directions. The place is unnervingly quiet. Though the [buildings, paths and gardens] are well-lit, the [sky] is completely [black].
The [first] floor [landing] forms a [mezzanine] here, overlooking the [lobby below]. It's a sort of [waiting room], placed right [outside] the [Central Administrator's] [office], which is through the [double doors] to the west. A [corridor] leads east, and a [grand staircase] leads down. Like the rest of the building, the [mezzanine] is deserted, but if anyone was [waiting] here, they would be able to sit on the [sofa] and read the [papers] on the [coffee table]. Or they might look at the rather [Administratively]-[themed artwork] on the [walls].
The [corridor] turns a [corner] here, continuing to the north and west. The [Security Administrator's] [office] is through a [door] to the east, and to the south, a short [staircase] leads downwards to a darkened [room].
This is the Administration Centre's [museum]. It's a vast [hall], stretching far away to the north and east. It is currently closed and in [darkness]. A [red rope] blocks passage to the north and east. [Light] is coming from the [corridor] to the south and faintly from a blank [video screen] just beyond the [rope]. [Exhibition] [displays] fill the [room], most too far away into the [dark] to be readable.
You are in a [cavernous room] built on the same vast scale as a concert hall. It cannot possibly fit within the buildings of the Administration [Centre] - the normal rules of [geometry] have clearly been bent here. You are standing in an [observation] [gallery] far [above] the floor, which is filled with concentric circles of [workstation] [desks]. All face the [centre] of the [room], where another [circular desk] is placed on a [raised platform]. [Above] all of this, a huge [three]-dimensional [globe] hangs in empty space. The dim [lighting] in the [room] comes mainly from the [planet], which glows with an internal [light]. To the north, [stairs] lead up to the [landing].
This is the bare, sterile room-with-a-[fridge] at work.
An [army] of cublicles are here, poised to overrun the world! The kitchen is north and the elevator is northeast.
Buttons numbered one to [three] on embedded in the [wall].
People walk up and down this [ribbon of old brick buildings], alternately holding hands and giving [each] other the [finger]. Since you're on vacation, you try to remain patient long enough to take in the [sights]; but since these are mostly made up of the [immense hotel] to the south, inside which is the convention, you find this difficult. [Alleys] open to the southeast and southwest, and a nearby [manhole] gapes from within [caution signs]. Amazingly, given their various apparent [conditions], the [passersby] seem to be heeding this [advice] (enough to avoid actually falling in, anyway).
On the [bumper] of a [car parked] nearby is a [sticker] that reads "Atari Age."
The [pavement] will take you southeast from here, if you let it. The [hotel] rises to your east, and returning northeast will take you back to the [boulevard].
You face the [entrance] to a [towering structure] with more [glass] than [bricks] (but a remarkable insurance plan). You can enter to the south, or walk around the [building] to the east or west. The [boulevard] annoys from the north.
The [carpet and chandeliers] are probably supposed to be [fancy], but they arrive at "[ugly]" long before that. A [double doorway of polished oak helpfully] breaks up the [sadistically] [floral paper] on the [eastern wall], while [carrot-colored] [stairs], not so much [winding] as actually [twisting], lead upward. You can [exit] the hotel to the north.
This is a [narrow area] to the [rear] of the [building]. A [steel crowbar] leans against the [wall, and alleys] lead northeast and northwest.
A nearby [parked car] wears an OC&GS [bumper sticker].
One [particular] [guy] stands [out], since he's not looking at any of the [products]. He's just looking [dejected].
You find yourself in an [overflow conduit] large enough to walk through, but not agreeably [fragrant] enough to stand still in. It's [blessedly dry], and a [mild draft] offers an even wider selection of [intriguing] [smells] to the southwest. A [bend] in the [tunnel] sends it off to the northwest.
You're standing in a [dry] but still [unpleasant] [box of concrete] beneath the [manhole], which is still within reach. To the southeast and southwest are [troublingly] [pipe]-sha]ped [[openings]. There's a [thin safety cable] here.
You might say it's a great natural resource (depending on what you're after), but the stench is unbelievable, and you can't quite bring yourself to imagine what lurks in the clumps of mud besides mud. Concrete tunnels lead northeast and northwest into the bank. There is, appropriately enough, a [Swordquest]: [Earthworld] [cartridge] here.
The [birds] sing to you, the wind whips your hair, and the dirt would feel good between your toes if this adventure were complex enough to let you remove your shoes. Here are found all the typical qualities: the [sparkling foam], the [glossy pebbles], the balls of flushed toilet paper.
For some reason, you're navigating a [concrete overflow tunnel], complete with accompanying [scents]. It's mercifully [dry] at the moment, and you even feel a [slight breeze] from the southeast (albeit not the familiar stimulating kind). Other [openings] lead south and northeast.
The [ugly carpeting] persists as this [plush corridor] briefly interrupts the [stairs], which lead up and down. There are [northern and southern doors, each] with a [device mounted] next to its [handle]. There's a [crumpled soda] can here.
Clutter and mess spread their way across the floor of your smallish room in Wall House, just west of the main [campus]. A [door] leads south to the hall, another west to the closet. Windows face east and north. Your [desk] sits against one wall, next to the north window.
Your few [clothes] hang here dejectedly in this walk-in closet, your room's only luxury. A bare lightbulb on the [ceiling] provides light.
The peeling paint on the walls creates a elegant counterpoint to the stained [greenish] [carpet]. Stairs lead down, and your room is north.
The front [door] leads you east and outside, while stairs go up and down.
The very first [thing] you notice about this place is the exits: four of them. North, south, east, and west. The north one has a [door] in it, though.
Against the rough north [wall] of the cavern lies a moon-shaped [landing] of white [stone], with a pair of [shallow steps] down to the [glass]-black surface of the [lake]. A [Moorish archway] leads away to the north.
You remember this place. The [animals], trapped in their [cages] and motionless -- presumably stuffed. In one cage is an [elephant], so short that he reaches only to your knee; you easily could lift [him] under one arm and carry [him] away. In another cage, a [giant mouse] lies, curled as though slumbering.
A whole strange grove of strange [trees], growing like ice out of the [ground]. They are made, as you recall, of [glass]. A [metal apple] hangs rather prominently from one of them.
Something took [out] the fluorescents, so the only [light] comes from your [helmet's] [forward] spot. Since you're facing the [wall] you twist your neck and look around frantically, your [spotlight] dancing across the remains of Node 4, before you realize [what] a bad idea moving your [head] fast is.
You are on a [dirt path]. There is an old, rundown [mansion] to the north, a [swamp] in the distance to the east, and to the west is an [overgrown cemetery].
You are in the [porch] of a [large gothic mansion].
You are on the edge of a [swamp]. There are the distant [ruins] of an old [mill] further to the east.
It has a [kitchen, bathroom], living area, all the appropriate stuff. There's a [bed], a [television], lots of [books and DVDs] on [shelves] or in face-down [piles]. North is the exit.
Your [desk] is in the northeast corner of this room, that you share with four other MicroSun employees. Their [desks] are to the south and southwest of here. To the west, you can hear the faint hum of the printer you all use. On each [desk], including yours, sits the mandatory [computer], the same model for everyone. Apart from that, your [desk] is cluttered with all kinds of [papers], half of which you don't use anymore. The other half you've never used. You just never took the time to throw it all away.
[Benny's] [desk] is even more cluttered than your own. If you would ever have to look for something in that [mess], you'd better ask [Benny]: alone you'd never find it. Mind you, maybe even [Benny] wouldn't find it. [Benny] takes a bite from a [sandwich].
This part of the room is usually occupied by Marc, the resident database specialist. He isn't here right now (typical! ), but his [desk] is still here, taking up [space]. (Much like Marc's job description, from what you've seen [him] do.) Marc's [desk] is remarkably empty. There is the mandatory [computer], of course, but there are not nearly as many papers as on the other [desks]. There is a [row of binders] on the [desk], but you can't recall anyone ever using one of them: it's probably just showing off by Marc.
This is the place where [Benny] usually works. [Benny] is an even better programmer than you are: one day you hope to be as smart as he is.
[Benny] is typing some code.
On the west [wall] is a [whiteboard]. The [door] out of the office is open. You could walk right out of here, if you wanted to.
Apart from being the place where John usually works, this is also the place where you can enter and leave the room: there is a [door] to the south, leading to freedom, to the outside, to Tanya... But only when you have finished your work here.
Everyone would probably be fighting for a chance to put their desk here, if it wasn't for the constant [hum] of the [printer] on the [windowsill].
This part of the room is generally considered the most pleasant, since there is a [window] here, making this the only [sunny] spot in an otherwise shadowy office. You don't see what the fuss is all about: that's what neon-[lighting] was invented for, wasn't it? And even that isn't necessary to use a monitor!
This is [William's] place. Although his [desk] looks much like the others, the same [computer, stacks] of papers and so on, the difference is in the details: these papers aren't filled with code, but with summaries of meetings, plans and schedules. [William] continually tries to convey the impression that his part of the room is in some way more important than the rest, being the nerve-centre of the project.
The humble [furnishings] elaborate the typical spartan collection of a Priestess living in the hinterlands. Having said that however, your hut is a veritable mansion compared to the sod shanties that the settlers use. The settlers have certainly been good to you since your arrival and have spared nothing in an attempt to make things more comfortable. In your hut you have your [bed], your [battle chest], a [night table], and a [long oak table] where various [tomes and herbs] lie. Next to a [torch] on the wall, a [curtained opening] leads out of your hut to the east.
You are currently in the Western Camp and residential area where most of the villagers live. Your [hut] lies to the west, and a number of the villagers' [sod shanties] surround you on all sides. Beyond the [shanties'] rooftops, you can see the [perimeter] of the fort's western [wall] come into sight. A weathered path east leads to the center of the outpost and the rest of camp.
A huge [gate] takes up most of the eastern section of this part of the fort. This is the entrance area to Ft. Aegea that also doubles as a place for its residents to [socialize]. It's relatively quiet at the moment (most people are out working), but there are still a few [children] playing games and some [old timers] busily chatting their mornings away. A path leads west back to the center of camp and the [perimeter wall] of the fort comes into full view to the east. As the rising sun creeps over the [wall], a towering shadow looms, leaving you, literally speaking of course, in the dark.
Livestock usually aren't allowed in the Fort but this area maintains a herd of [cows] and a handful of [chickens] for internal egg and milk production. The [animals] squawk and moo loudly in a huge [pen] that takes up the entire south end of the fort. A path north leads back to the center of camp, and beyond the [pen] you can just make out the top of the [perimeter wall].
Bucketloads of [corn, oats, and canola] surround you in what is the agricultural processing center for Ft. Aegea and its surrounding areas. [Workers] diligently hull [oats and canola], and dehusk [corn]. The [food] that's processed here is stored in some of the many [silos] in the area, and then sent to some of the southern cities and townships in Amylya whose soils aren't fertile enough to produce [legumes]. A path leads back the center of camp. Just behind the processing area, you can make out the top of the [perimeter wall] to the north.
You no longer exist in a single place, really. But what's left of you tries to make sense of it that way. So it feels like you're in a [foggy room]. Thick and slow to move through. Exits to the north, south, east, west and northeast.
This is a [room] made of winding rows of brick. The floor, ceiling, walls. It's weird. Exits west and also down a brick staircase.
A cool brick [room] with a low ceiling. The walls slowly shift back and forth, as if unreal. There's what you perceive to be an alcove to the southeast.
A storage area. The brick floor is interrupted by a smattering of [sand], which doesn't seem to belong. Exit to the northwest.
You are deep [underwater], heavy and blue. Exits north and down.
Endless desert. Muted yellow [sand] whistles by. The dryness is [somehow] familiar and soothing. Exits east and south.
A deep [oasis], nestled here in the otherwise endless [sand]. Exit to the northeast.
You are in a a small room with barely enough space to house the essentials for living which comprise a [computer], a DVD player and a [fridge] stocked with liquid refreshment. You could go north to the conservatory or south to the hallway.
You are in a dark and dingy entrance hall. There is a pile of junk mail on the [door] mat. You could go north to your living room or south to your front [door].
You are in a conservatory which is currently fulfilling the function of a junk store for anything you haven't got round to throwing [out] yet: a pile pf Betamax videos, decrepit old computer monitors and a broken lawn mower are piled in the centre of the room. You could go north to your back garden or south to your living room.
Unlit, except for the single [spotlight]; unfurnished, except for the defining [swath of black velvet]. And a [placard] on a little [stand].
You stand leaning against the [balustrade]. Your [breath] is visible as [steam]. It whirls and sways in the westward [breeze], floating in the direction of your [bedroom]. The [night] is lit with [stars and flashes of distant artillery] fire.
You turn your head slowly, gaining a panoramic view of the interior: [bed, lamp, swaying curtains], large unseen portion of the [room] to the west. Nothing reflects irregularity. Nothing, except the open [cage] on the [night-table].
Woodwork and [artistry] reminiscient of the far east bring to mind an oriental atmosphere. [Glass doors] lead the way southwards to the street whence you came, but returning that way would be admitting defeat. The main dining area is to the east, and a short corridor leads north toward the restrooms. There is a small [rack of take]-out [menus] by the [exit]. A [waiter stands] guard, blocking the way to the dining room.
This short corridor connects the lobby to the south with the [bathrooms] east (MEN) and west (WOMEN). Unfortunately, [signs] on [both] bathroom [doors] indicate that they're out of order. Hopefully you can hold it until you get home. Also of interest here are a [pay phone] (mounted on the [wall]) and a [pile of mud] (sitting on the floor).
The [garden] is such a nice little [patch] of green for a novice [gardener] like [yourself]. There's even a [small fish pond]. [Flowers] are already in full bloom in the flower [bed] and there's an [empty patch] ready for [vegetables]. The [grass] looks a bit dry.
It's a delightful little shed even though it has seen better days. Wear and tear just adds to the charm. The [walls] have been plastered with [newspapers] and there are several [boxes] full of miscellaneous [junk].
This paved blacktop [road] was constructed to connect the visitor center to the observation tower. The [road] runs north and south. Wetlands extend to the east.
The [road] runs southwest and northwest.
What commonly gets called a "swamp" is actually the most extraordinary ecosystem on the planet. Water and grass extend as far you can see, filled with an incredible variety of birds and fish and turtles and (of course!) [alligators].
The [road] runs north and southeast and south.
You are standing in a secluded [alley]. The [sun] is mostly shielded by the [buildings] to either side and to the south. To the north, you see the [road and parking lot] where the [bus] had previously been. Behind you is a thick [wall], with a nice soft [pile of dirt] to nap on. But now that the [wind] is picking up, blowing straight into the [alley], you doubt that you'd be able to sleep there anymore!
A wide, dusty [road] stretches east and west here, punctuated only by a few [cracks] in the dry earth. [Decrepit buildings] - few safe to enter after their many years of decay - line [both] sides of the street. To the north is the [parking lot] where the Wavemotion Tour [Bus] deposited you just a couple of hours ago - now empty, with a pair of [tire marks] stretching across the hard-packed [ground] back to the [highway]. Directly to the south is the secluded [alley] where you rested.
You stand at a small intersection with almost no shade, the [sun] baking down upon you. To the east stands a solid - at least by the standards of this town - and largely intact [building] with a lonely [flagpole] rising upwards. The [road] stretches west and south past a series of collapsed [houses] and broken-down [walls].
You are standing inside a [small] room with a high [counter] in front of you and [two] walls lined with square [slots], as if to hold [incoming mail]. There is a [small [mailbox]] attached to the wall labeled "[Outgoing]". The [windows] have long broken, and many of the [openings] are filled with the dry, dusty [sand] of this town's dry, dusty roads. [Below] many of the [openings] are [small brass name-plates]. Only a few remain legible. [ohue, Vakla, and gharc] you read on one row.
The dry [dirt road] heads west toward a ramshackle [building] with a large wooden [sign] swinging slowly in the breeze, hanging from one [chain]. The faded [sign] reads "[Drew] the [Dane's] Gen__al St_re, If It Looks Good We Prob'ly Made It". Before the [building], the [road] opens up into a small [crossroads], framing a [stone well]. The [road] continues [both] east and south along the edges of town.
You are standing in a room full of sad, empty [shelves]. A [counter] stands to one side, a battered, vintage (and heavy!) [cash register] standing open. Several [racks] that may at one time have held [clothes] fill the main floor, mostly broken and littering the [ground]. A single [square of cloth] is trapped [below] them.
You stand at a crossroads, with the road heading north and east. A large [building] with paneled swinging doors stands to your south. The [sign] hanging [above] says "The Lucky Hor_esh__". To your west is a low iron fence. Are those [gravestones] you see beyond? More decrepit [buildings] surround you, covered by more [graffiti].
This street continues east and west across the town. To the north is the only [stone building] you've seen in the town, with a large sheriff's [star] emblazoned on the [door] and just one small [window]. To the south, [two painted horses] dance across a large [wooden building]. Suddenly the [wind] whistles, and a [tumbleweed] rolls by!
This spacious [barn] must have once been the town stable, as the [four stalls] are all covered with dried [straw]. The rickety [walls] hold several [hooks], though only one holds anything now - a battered [shovel]. You can go back north to Main Street or South into an open corral.
A small fenced-in area stands behind the stable, the stout wooden [posts] looking fit to hold a bucking bronco with a double [gate] offering the only entrance. But the corral is mostly bare, save for a [mule] looking lonely and forlorn in the far corner. Ah, you remember - the tour guide promised the children a [mule] ride, didn't he? But he also held up [chaps] and spurs, claiming that [Molly the] [Mule] really rubbed some people the wrong way and needed a bit of sharp encouragement to move forward. And you're sure he said something about a saddle... The Corral borders a wide expansive field to the south which is also mostly barren - typical of the landscape you've become accustomed to.
You are standing in what can only be the sheriff's office. A stout [desk] sits before you, what looks like a [Roman Emperor's] [head] is carved on the front. A [rifle rack] sits on one wall but is empty. There are [two hangers] to either side of the [rack] - the one of the left is empty but mounted on the one to the right is a huge [steer's skull]. The back of the room is caged off into a [jail cell]. Inside is a sight for sore [eyes] indeed - a [cot], whose supple leather looks like a nice place to rest!
Standing in this old cemetery doesn't exactly inspire confidence that you will make it through the night here in this one-horse town. Life in the old days was harsh - likely many of those buried here are younger than you are now. Grass has grown over most of the area between a myriad of [headstones]. [Gravestones] litter the landscape - most of the [inscriptions] are worn off but there are a few still readable. You can exit back to the town by going east.
You are standing in an old Saloon. [Smashed tables] fill one side of the room and a deluxe [bar] spans the other side. You can almost picture the lawmen, miners, and cowboys eying [each] other suspiciously across the well-worn [bar]. In the middle of the room hangs an enormous wrought iron [chandelier]. Near the back wall stands a large [piano], a large [plaque] on the wall [above] it. As your eyes adjust to the dim [light], you see the keys moving up and down on their own. Oh my darling, oh my darling....
You are at the entrance to the graveyard. A heavy iron [gate] creaks in the wind. A stone [path] runs north through the center of the graveyard.
A stone [path] runs north and south through the center of the graveyard. In the middle of the [path] is an old wooden [bench]. To the east is a vicious gnarled old tree, to the west is an ancient, leprous, small stone crypt.
The northern end of the [graveyard] has three wonderfully unique [tombstones] climbing up out of the bare earth. A stone [path] runs south through the center of the [graveyard].
The grass is overgrown on the west side of the graveyard. You spot the stone [crypt] camouflaged by the darkness.
Here on the east side of the graveyard towers a knotted old oak [tree] waving slightly in the ghostly breeze.
More by memory than by the dim [light] can you find your way south to the kitchen or east to your workshop. The [back door] is a [faint [outline]] to the north.
This side of the [yard] is green and almost perfectly level. The [night air] is just the right temperature, and you have an excellent view of the [stars]. As long as the [wind] isn't blowing [out] of the [trees] to the north, it smells just as pleasant.
You've never entirely subscribed to that "[everything] in its place" maxim, but there is, in fact, a [bed] here. This is where you do the majority of your dreaming, but now you've got more important things to do.
It's very dark in here, and the [room] is filled with [junk]. You have to rely mostly on your sense of touch to identify [individual] [objects].
You again stare in disbelief at your [filthy] floor. The faintly [glowing] [remains] of yesterday's [fire] reveal your sewing [room] to the east and the front [door] to your south.
It's here that you do all your [sewing] work. Often your [neighbors] will bring you clothes to alter or other pieces to make.
Two [fence lines] extend southward toward the [main gate]. The rest of the [farm] stretches away to the east and west.
You're in [pleasant meadows] south of the domesticated [animal] pens.
This narrow [gully] runs south towards the [main gate], and is [fenced] on [both] sides.
A [dirt road] runs south to the [state highway], some [two] and a half miles distant.
And so it stands before you, a [house] that could have been cozy, if not for the [peeling blue paint], the flying [gargoyles] encircling the [roof], and the looming twelve-foot tall [fence] with '[WARNING]: Electrified' [painted] in [blood red letters]. The [yard] on this side of the [fence] continues to the east and west. The main [gate], dutifully keeping you out of [Alden Manor] proper, lies directly to the north. If you wish to give up on this grand adventure, there is a [path] leading south back to civilization.
You are standing east of the front [gate]. The eastern [yard of Alden Manor] is visible just beyond the [gate]. The [fence] continues in this direction and looks quite grim. Every now and again it [creaks] even when there's no [wind]. Nearby several [storm crows] nest on [telephone wires] attached to a rather gaunt [pole].
You are standing west of the front [gate]. The [fence] continues in this direction until it fades into [darkness] further west. At the base of the [fence] there is a [utility box]. On the other side of the [fence], you can see into the west [yard of Alden Manor]. You can return back to the front [gate] by going east.
You are clinging to the top of the [telephone pole] roughly 40 feet from the [ground]. It's quite a [view]! A [telephone wire] runs over the [fence] and spans across to the [house].
From this small office you write, edit, print, and distribute the Malnoxet Gazette, the finest [newspaper] on the northern frontier. It's also quite possibly the only [newspaper] on the northern frontier.
This is your room only because it's slightly too big to be called a closet. There's barely enough room in here for your [bed], and the [piles of newspapers and stove] are tempting fate by being in such close proximity. At least you've managed to avoid the splattering of old ink that coat the rest of the office.
One [cupboard] in particular demands your attention and a [body] slumped on the floor brings back uneasy memories. The open doorway is South.
The 'Treatment' room. All the inmates associate this place with pain and suffering. Threatening machinery glares at you from around the [walls].
I can also see:- A [rather large fire], blocking the stairway down.
It has the mediocre nicety of a place that doesn't want to look cheap. [Two Two sleeping bags]  are rolled up behind a [plywood table], with a dark brown (and mostly empty) [Cabinet] on the wall. This place is small and cramped, smells like air freshener with a tang of fish and the floor is moving. So, being here is like throwing up on a disco toilet. A small stair leads up, to the stern.
The stern is quite spacious. It has to be, as it not only contains a [bench] that runs along it, but also a sort of huge, white supporter on which rests [Uncle Wallys] coffin, its lid broken. A small [ladder] leads into the water.
At any [point] in the [game], type  "[Menu]", [for] instructions, and to learn a [little] about this [game].
A plush 1930's Southern railway [carriage]. The [carriage] is full of sumptuous detail. High back, plush ruby red [seating]. Golden oak [tables], and decorated [wall panels]. All lit by the orange flickering flame of brass [oil lamps]. Sitting across the table from you is [Ingrid].
A small town station, complete with [framed timetables] and a [ticket office]. The building is painted white. Main Street lies to the west.
You're in an abandoned barbershop. Apparently on one is in need of a shave or haircut today. You also notice some [writing] on the wall. The only exit is north to the street.
You're in a [telegraph] office. There's a certain atmosphere of effectiveness and punctualness. The only exit is south to Main St.
This is a [large] square room with many [tables and chairs] for guests. Behind the [bar] is a [large mirror]. Strangely, the room seems deserted.
You're in a wooden building with white walls and many [shelves]. A few [customers] are browsing the [goods]. There's an exit south to Main St.
You give the place a once-over with your right eye. Then you turn your head and look at [everything] through your left eye. It doesn't make any difference. The farther parts of the room remain [out] of focus.
The [room] is a [cube], about 20 feet on each side. The [walls], floor, and [ceiling] are all made of what appears to be beige [plastic]. There are no visible doors or windows, and the [plastic] itself seems to be giving off light.
Your shrine has seen better days. The gold plate is peeling off your two statues (one [male], one female, embracing), and the floor is fuzzed with [mold] and the candywrappers of tourists. The [sarcophagus] itself could handle a refurbishing as well. A V-shaped [trough] leads south into the rest of the shrine complex.
This is the hub of the shrine complex. Wondrous [tapestries and treasures] and all that good stuff are all around. A dingy little hallway leads north to your shrine.
Your stall is wooden structure lined with [straw]. It smells a little unpleasant. Another stall lies to the west, and the rest of your [enclosure] lies to the north and east.
You are standing on the yellow [grit path] that runs to the south of your [enclosure]. The [path] winds towards you from the west and continues to the east, interrupted only by a broad [wooden bridge] spanning a gently flowing [river]. The [river] runs along the eastern border of your [enclosure] and continues babbling south; another [path] breaks off to follow it.
You come to a crossroads of sorts. A [path] runs north and south along the western bank of the [river], while another runs off to the west.
You stand at the entrance of the [lion enclosure]. A strong, high [fence] separates you from the dangers lurking within. One of whom is standing there looking at you through the [gate]. A [path] rises back eastwards to an [observation] [platform] and beyond.
You stand before the [gate] of a small [enclosure] that looks more like a rockery garden. The path runs east to west here, but further progress westwards has been made impossible by a [cattle grid]. Which is a shame, really, as you've heard there are kangaroos and wombats down this way.
You are in long curving room; almost a corridor, in fact. It curves around to the west and to the south. The inner of the two walls is made up of a series of [tanks], [each] of which contains [stones, vegetation], heat lamps and so on. [Everything] to keep a [reptile] happy. What you don't see are many actual [reptiles] ? presumably they have hidden themselves away to sleep. The [tank] in front of which you now stand, though, is an exception.
You are in long room, or possibly a wide corridor, that curves around to the north and to the west. Lining the inner of the two walls is a series of large [tanks], [each] of which contains the [paraphernalia] associated with well cared-for [reptiles] ? [branches], [logs, rocks] and so on. The [reptiles] themselves, though, are hard to spot; possibly it's the dim light, possibly they've hidden themselves away to sleep. In one of these [tanks], though, the occupant is clearly visible.
The [pathway] on which you stand is bounded by low [stone walls] as it runs over a [weir]. The [weir] separates the [pond] to the northeast from the [lake] that expands away, at a lower level, to the southwest. The [path] runs north, following the [river] that feeds the [pond], and south to a wide paved area. You can see another [path] running west which would have remained inconspicuous had some fool not seen fit to stick a [sign] in the middle of it.
You emerge into what is clearly a backstage area of the zoo. There are [silos] containing different types of food, and various [smaller containers] used to transport it to the different enclosures.
You are in the middle of a large paved area bounded by water features to the north and [buildings] on the remaining three sides. The [buildings] have been shuttered and boarded up for the night.
You are in a small, brick-paved courtyard. High [walls tower] over you to the north and south.
You are at the edge of a [clearing] with an impressive [view] of the [mountains]. A trail splits off toward some [standing stones] to the southwest, while the main [road] emerges from the [forest] to the east and continues [westward] down the [hill], via a series of switchbacks.
The [road] here is a swath of [mud], hardly more penetrable than the [forest] it cuts. The main [road] continues to the west, and a smaller trail leads south.
A [tent] stands on the rocky shore of the [stream]. To the north, a [wooden bridge] spans the [stream]. A path follows the bank to the east.
A [grove of oaks]. The [ground] rises sharply to the south, and a [mausoleum] is set into the side of the hill. Everything-- [trees, tomb], and hillside-- is covered with thick [moss], interrupted only by [palapala ferns] and a few patches of [bark and bare stone].
Silver [facets], each several inches wide and irregularly shaped, cover the [walls] and ceiling. On the [center] of the floor, a [circle] is etched in the rock. To the north, northeast, and south, [arches] open into [tunnels].
A roaring [waterfall] pours into a [pool] from high above to the North; you can see the eroded layer of [stone] where the road passes behind it. You stand where the path ends, at the stony shore of the [pool].
This is your porch. Icky. [Books, papers, filth, and stuff] you don't seriously want to think about is all over the place. Your book isn't here, though... where the bleep is it?
This is your [patio]. There are a few [bits of paper, plastic, and cloth] strewn about haphazardly.
You are just outside your [shed]. There's nothing much to see here.
[Stuff] on the floor was probably [newspaper] once.
This is your kitchen. Except for the [oven] and the [closet, everything] is covered with [dusty papers].
Yes, even your [computer room] is a [mess]. The only [object] of any importance here is the [computer].
Your [office]. It is situated solitary in a small [building], away from the major block. This could be due to the fact that you are a private detective and this is the entrance to the Channel Tunnel.
Of course, you never really wanted to be a private detective. You're also a great inventor, but most of your [projects] never really took off mainstream and now just litter the floor, along with other assorted [debris]. An [exit] leaves north, directly opposite the staircase.
"Tittle-Tattle Kettle, your teatime's long-brewed, boiling gossip!" You always thought this motto was a little bit silly, but it's quite original after all; it didn't stop this magazine to grow. In fact, sales are good, and the paper shows its difference from its rivals with a certain sense of ethics and reflexion - it still is a gossip magazine, but let's say that you take advantage of a higher status than your rivals. The [editorial] office is at the [sixteenth] floor of the building. Westwards, the [window] gives you a great [view] of the [city]; near it there's the [coffee dispenser and metal tables]. Eastwards, it's [Sammy's] office; your office is somewhere to the north, and if you want to leave there's an [elevator] at the south.
You're one of the few journalists to have an office at the editorial office of "Tittle-Tattle Kettle"; the magazine hires copywriters and free-lance journalists, but you have your own office to write your articles. Nothing special about the room itself: all [messed] up, [papers] everywhere on the [desk], your [computer] and a few [chairs]. It's your base camp, where you go to write your articles, to sort [photos], to search information, in a nutshell: to do your job.
Standing in the vacant lot [behind] the [store], you see a few brown weeds, not much else-- like your dad always said, 'Well, child, vacant is as vacant does.' Course, he was talking about your grades. You notice a dumpster to the west. The road to Deanna Vale's house is south.
There's a big, [blue dumpster] here. Most of the store's trash seems to be strewn around the [dumpster], instead of inside it. The side parking lot is to the north. There's a vacant lot to the east.
This is the [side lot], where robbers and shoplifters like to park, because it's difficult for the clerk to see over here. If you owned a car, you would have parked here. The gas pumps and main parking [lot] are to the east, and the dumpster area is to the south. A trailer park is to the west.
You stand in the front [parking lot], near the [gas pumps]. The [parking lot] continues to the east. The store is to the south. A small side [lot] sits to the west. The busy highway surrounds the store on all other sides.
A shady little area, it reeks like stale [beer]. [Broken bottles] litter the ground. The front [lot] is to the west.
Standing in the [store's] front entrance, you see many places to go. The parking lot is to the north. Aisles sit to the southeast and the southwest. The counter is to the east, and the [ATM] area is to the west.
You stand in front of the [counter]. The [clerk], naturally, stands behind it. The [register] is here. The front area of the store is to the west. The employee area is to the east. The snack aisle is to the south.
Potato [chips], pretzels, [spam, spam, spam], it's all here. Artery-clogging goodness. "God forbid you ever be hungry, even for a second," reads the logo on one of the bags of [chips]. The front of the store is to the northwest. The counter is to the north. The beer cooler is to the south. The [restroom] is to the east. The candy aisle is to the west.
[Candy] here. Mmmm, [candy]. If not for that nightmarish incident with a shopping mall Santa and a [candy] cane when you were little, you might still enjoy [candy]. The snack aisle is to the east. The coffee area is to the south. The [ATM] is to the north. The front area of the store is to the northeast.
This is the [automatic teller machine area]. The candy aisle is to the south, and the front [area] of the store is to the east.
You feel very much at home in this living room (possibly because this is the living room of your home). You have a knot in your stomach when you think about Beth, waiting at your kitchen table (to the east) for the breakfast you promised her but cannot deliver. You want to hide in your [closet] rather than admit this to her, but you know that she'll find you. The mysterious knocking sound that comes from the [closet] will give you up in moments. You have a passing desire to run through the southern [door] into your [bedroom] and bury your head under your pillow, but dismiss this idea knowing that you do at least have one thing in that kitchen of yours to cook for breakfast.
This is your [bedroom]. That is, it is the room you keep your [bed] in. Once, for a passing moment, you considered keeping your [bed] in the kitchen, but being a social sheep, you decided to opt for conformity.
Like most kitchens it has a [refrigerator and counters]. A small [electrical] [outlet] is centered in the [wall] just above the counter tops. You also have a [table] centered neatly in this room.
The [kitchen] of your eatery is expansive and well-organized. A [large oven and rangetop] with an adjacent [counter] fill up one side of the room, next to the [pneumatic tube station] and a row of [hanging utensils]. Above the [oven] are several [fishtanks] for your fresh [seafood]. [Rows of cupboards] and an [ugly glass cabinet] line the remaining [walls], along with an [industrial] [dishwasher], a [refrigerator], and a [large sink]. Actually, when you break it all down it starts to feel a bit cramped in here.
Some laughed when you announced your intentions to open a five-star gourmet eatery with a 1940s decor, but as you glance around fondly at chrome-[buffed [tables]], World War 2 [recruitment] [posters], the [big band quintet] in the corner, and the [pneumatic tube food delivery system], you wonder, who's laughing now?
This awkwardly shaped [supply closet] is wedged behind the stage the band plays on, and is full of [various janitorial] [bric-a-brac], [maintenance] [tools], a [roll of unused carpet], a [huge cardboard box], a [stack] of first aid kits, and other [rubbish].
This small basement was easily converted into a wine [cellar] during your rennovation. A selection of [wines] are neatly stacked against one [wall], and a [large freezer] is pressed against the other, next to the bulky [hub] of the [pneumatic tube system].
As the great gourmand Brillat-Savarin once noted, "to bring a person into your house is to take charge of his happiness for as long as he is under your roof." You took his message to heart in designing this classy [restroom], while still keeping your theming in mind: only the finest [porcelain toilets], only the finest [formica sinks, vintage sheet music] adorning the [walls], and a [large mural of president Harry Truman] covering the [ceiling], smiling benignly down on your diners as they conduct their business.
You had rather intended to leave a bit more room for your owner's [office], but what with one thing and another and the stove measurements being in metric, not that anyone should [bother] to tell you, it turned out to be more of a closet. A [small desk] overflowing with [supply orders, zoning paperwork, invoices, and recipes] occupies about eighty percent of the available space, along with a [tiny wooden chair]. A [cordless phone] hangs on the [wall].
You're in the predictably dark and dank [dungeon] of the Queen of France. Well, it's not too dark thanks to a [torch] that vigorously illuminates a few [words] carved beneath it. A [pile of bones] and an old [blanket] have been discarded to a corner. The [door] keeping you here is to the west.
A [vast] underwater hall, empty of life. Bizarre [wine]-making machines fill the room, and a passage leads out to the north.
The Octopus' Garden restaurant is a quiet, exclusive place. Right now, there's no-one in sight save for the [Big White Chef himself].
The [Farfalla] is one of the grand old San Francisco [hotels]. Not the sort of place you'd go on your own. But then you're not here because you wanted to be. It's eight stories of still pretty much gleaming white marble, and no doubt a room costs as much a night as your apartment does for the month.
It really is one of the grand hotels. The floor is colored [marble], there are [fluted columns] supporting the [ceiling], the [ceiling] is high and painted a deep [blue]. There are two awfully [comfortable]-looking [wing chairs] and a [side table] grouped around an unlit [fireplace].
There are three [elevators] here, though two are marked closed for cleaning. There are two [elevator] call [buttons] for up and down. An [indicator light] shows which floor the [elevator] is currently at.
The [sea] forms an unbroken [horizon] around you; as the [ground] approaches the [water], the [grass] turns to rock and the angle of descent increases. The shore curves around behind you in both directions, probably terminating somewhere on the other side of the irregular [hill] to your back. The only place to go is up the [slope] behind you toward a ridge holding a small cubical building, which is further crested by an irregular columns on the [hilltop] above.
You're about half-way up the [hill], here, and the prevailing architecture is a curious cubical [gazebo]. Three sides of the structure are [sealed] with translucent [plastic], but the [plastic] on the fourth side is loose, permitting entrance. A column stand on the [hill's] crest; below this point is only the shore.
The [hill's] modest peak affords a view of the [island's] ovoid shoreline. The decline levels [out] a short way below you where the [cube] is situated, its plate-[metal] roof featureless a dull shade of brown in the gloom.
The cubical [gazebo] consists of a [metal] floor, four [metal] columns, and a [metal] roof welded together. One of the columns houses a large [lever] with a striped [red-and-yellow handle], currently raised. Four [sheets] of clear [plastic] are stretched between ceiling and floor to [seal] off the sides of the [box], but one of the [sheets] is loose at the bottom, and all four [sheets] have gaps in the [seal] where [water] has loosened the adhesive.
You are just outside the [main door] to the [lair] of the deathlord Ornomir, standing on a nearly invisible, [earth]-covered path on a steep mountainside, which slopes away to a green valley far below, through which you can barely see a winding river, [brown] with mud.
I'm standing in a small open space, paved with dirt, just [outside] a wide iron [gate], which is set in a tall [fence] to the south. To either side, giant [oak trees], so close together that not even a mouse could pass, stretch so far upwards that they seem to touch the sky. Underneath their boughs, the [path] I walk is as dusky as sunset, though I know the hour is not yet late.
A rectangular [grid] of overgrown [plots] stretch [out] around me. To the south, an angular white marble [building] with a [blue door] rises from the indistinct sea of poorly maintained [gravestones]. To the north, a wide [rusty gate], heavy iron [hinges] rusted over, rests, permanently half open. The [gate] is mounted in an equally weathered heavy iron [fence], which circles the area. The tops of [ancient oaks] peer over the [high wall] on all sides save the north.
The [path] through the [forest] splits here, leading east, west, and south. The [undergrowth] from the north is thick and prevents further progress in that direction.
Here brambles have taken over the way, and block it completely except for a [path] leading east under several low-hanging [branches].
I'm walking along a narrow [path] through the [trees] which leads [out] of sight to the east and west. [Roots] criss-cross the [path] here and make the walk lumpy and uneven.
I'm on a slowly winding [path] through the [forest] on a long gentle curve between north and west.
I've arrived at the edge of the [forest], and am standing just under the edge of the [trees]. Before me to the north is a wide open plain; across it I see [mountains] in the distance, their white-tipped teeth rooting dark [clouds] hanging far above.
I'm standing in a wide open space, painted with brilliant [green grasses] which stretch off to the horizon. Far to the north there are [mountains] that look like they're painted on the edge of the world, and to the south I can see a border of dark [green]; a forest. To the east and west the [sky] meets the [grass].
You are in the second floor hallway of the McMurtry building. To the east, a stairway leads down to the first floor. Your [office] is to the south. The friendly-looking [welcome mat] that you purchased sits expectantly in front of the [door].
This is the reception area outside of your [office]. A [door] to the north leads out into the hallway. In one corner of the room, next to the opening that leads east into your [office], is the small [desk] that [Marge] uses. A [coat rack] stands beside the [door].
Your office is amazingly messy considering you only just moved in a month ago. At one end of the room is a cluttered [desk] and, behind it, a [large, comfy] looking [chair]. On the other [side] of the [desk] is a [small chair], presumably meant for clients (although you haven't had any yet). The reception area lies to the west, and a [window] looks out onto the [street] to the east.
On the other [side] of the [desk] is a [small chair], presumably meant for clients (although you've only had one so far).
You are in the [foyer] of the McMurtry building. To the west, [stairs] lead up to the second floor. There are [large glass double doors] east of here leading out onto the street.
You are standing on the [sidewalk] in front of the [McMurtry Building]. [Large glass double doors] lead inside to the west, and above them you can see an [office window]. [Cars, trucks, and taxis] drive by at regular intervals. The [sidewalk] runs north (to a [dirty streetcorner]) and south. A [large], blue [mailbox] sits next to the [doors], and next to the [mailbox] is a stamp [vending machine].
The [sidewalk] here runs past run-down [apartment buildings], most of which are not officially inhabited. A group of men are playing [cards] in the entryway of a boarded up [building]. Your heart races as you recognize their faces -- [Roderick, Morty, and Vincent]. They are the [thugs] that Jimmy Voigt pays to do his collecting for [him].
You are standing in a small [woods] near the beltway. Rumors of dark things happening here mark it as a place not to tarry about. Game trails lead in all directions.
[Terminal] [Room] This is a large [room] crammed with [computer] [terminals], small [computers], and printers.
Third Floor This is the third floor of the [Computer] Center. An [elevator] and call [button] are on the south side of the hallway. Stairs also lead down, for the energetic. To the north is a [glass wall] beyond which you can see a [computer] [room] crammed with [computer] [equipment].
Smith Street Smith Street runs east and west along the north side of the main campus area. At the moment, it is an arctic wasteland of howling wind and drifting [snow]. On the other side of the street, barely visible, are the lidless [eyes] of streetlights. The street hasn't been plowed, or if it has been, it did no good.
Smith Street Smith Street runs west towards the computer center here. To the south is a dilapidated grey wooden building. The street is an impassable sea of blowing and drifting [snow].
Beside your [bed] is a small [nightstand]. A [wardrobe] stands opposite your [bed] and there's a writing [desk] by the [window]. There is an inexplicable [black hole] in the floor. There is a [door] in the northeastern corner of the room, leading to the hallway.
The hallway connects all the rooms in your apartment. The living-room is to the east while the kitchen is to the west and your [bedroom] is to the southwest. Rather unnervingly, the front [door] leading [out], to the south, seems to have disappeared completely. Somewhat unexpectedly, there seems to be an extra room to the north.
This is a small featureless room, no bigger than a closet. There is a metal [ladder] ascending straight up into the darkness. The upper end of the [ladder] is not visible.
On the [kitchen table] are some [leftovers] of the [pizza] that you ordered last night but couldn't finish.
Normally it is of course a charming [living-room]. You see a [sofa], a [table] and a [television] here.
It's your [apartment], and it's in the usual [mess]. The [mess], in fact, threatens to take control of the whole [apartment]. Not that you have too much time to worry about it right now, of course. You have to find your way to Mr deMause's [apartment] ... The [door] to the south leads out into the foggy night, and that seems like a good place to start.
You hadn't realised until stepping out tonight how dim the [fog] could be. The [pea-souper] spreads out in all directions, obscuring your vision. The steps leading down to the south disappear into it. Back to the north, the door leads back into the warmth of home.
Pea-[souper] [fog] blankets [everything]. You know more by instinct than anything else that the way home is just to the north. Otherwise, all the streets leading out from here are alien to you.
The cemetary is quite small. It used to be the private [graveyard] for the generations of Sherwoods that lived in the house. About thirty years ago, Elbert Sherwood opened the cemetary for the entire village. And ten years ago, after the remaining Sherwoods were murdered on [Halloween], the town alderman renamed the cemetary. A fence surrounds the cemetary, separating it from the woods to your west, and the rest of the cemetary to your north.
You are standing [out] by the [road], and a large [mountain] looms on the other side of it. You can barely make [out] the faint, white noise of rushing water coming far from the southeast. To the west of you is a clearing in the briers which provides an entrance to the woods.
You are on the beginning of a dirt [trail] in the woods that leads north. A clearing in the briers to the east will take back to the road.
You are standing in the campsite that you and [Fred] made years ago. A large, dome-shaped [tent] sits on the dirt. A nice [fire] blazes in the [firepit]. Most of the leaves have been cleared [out] of this roughly fifty-by-fifty foot area. The trail which brought you here continues north, or you can head back south towards the road.
You are on a bank of Brown [River], which is to the east. It appears to have a strong current. The roaring ambient sound of water rushing down the [river] is so loud here that it drowns [out] all other sounds of the area. A path leads to the northwest.
This is where you work. You spend a large proportion of your conscious life here in what some might consider tedium and drudgery. The [desk] by the [window] is, unprecedently, devoid of brochures. A [door] leads out.
A [drive] wide enough for several coaches side-by-side leads north to the imposing [facade of Hamilton Hall], occasional residence of [Lord Stoattrouser]. The [gravel] is flanked on either side by stands of [poplars and yews]. To the west is your [booth], and to the east are the gardens. South apparently takes you outside the grounds.
You stand on the top [step] between marble [pilasters]. Facing you are the open [doors] of the [House], while a wide [gravel drive] leads south.
Four [paths] lead through the [rose beds] and converge here. The [gardens] are oddly deserted except for a [strange couple] sitting on a [bench] near the [peonies].
Three paths from the west, northeast and southeast meet at an [oak tree].
Although visited less often, the grounds had to be completed with two ornamental [gateposts]; something makes you think of the grey stone [eagles] perched atop them more as vultures. The house looks imposing in the northern [landscape] even from this distance, and a path leads northeast through the shrubbery. South would take you beyond your prescribed area.
You are in a rectangular, baroque-themed room. [Portraits] decorate the [walls] and a long-[case clock] stands silently. A [round rosewood writing-desk] can be seen pushed against the wall.
This part of the house is modern and vacant. The room is lit with a [chandelier and frescos] decorate the [walls]. A [door] goes east.
A [round] chamber, which is decorated in a Tudor style. The [walls] are hung with [etchings], while the [walls] are covered with flocked wallpaper. An irregularly-shaped [table] is tastefully positioned.
This modest room is baroque in appearance. The [walls] are hung with [frescos] and each wall is covered with flocked wallpaper. A wide staircase goes down, and you can also go east and west. A squat mahogany [dresser] is next to the [door].
This part of the house is Elizabethan and oblong. The room reeks of ancient scents, while the [walls] are hung with [portraits]. You can see a low [rosewood dresser] placed conveniently.
This part of the house is rococo and rectangular. The [walls] are hung with [landscapes] and a [long-case] [clock] stands silently. A [round rack] can be seen in an unobtrusive corner. A passage goes east.
A miserable [grey cell], complete with [drips and echoes and gloom]. The only [exit] leads upward. [Professor Evil], your tormentor for the past several weeks, lies dead on the floor.
A bland, suburban sort of [living room]. To the north is the [kitchen]; to the west the [bedroom], and to the south is the [door] leading [outside]. [Stairs] lead down to Professor Evil's holding [cell].
An ordinary [kitchen], with lingering smells of [coffee and breakfast]. The [living room] is to the south, and an old [refrigerator] lurks in one corner.
While your living room isn't much to look at, you call it home. Back when you were working 80 hours a week, you had no time to fix the place up. Now that you have all the time in the world, you have no [money]. Even in hard times, you retain your sense of irony. Your ratty [couch] sits along one [wall], facing your cheap (and empty) [entertainment] [center]. The front [door] of your home is to the NORTH. Your dining room lies WEST, and your bedroom is to the SOUTH.
The word "room" is a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a nook, and a sparse one at that. In the middle of the room on top of a [rug] sits a small [table and two chairs]. On the wall is a small [tack] where you hang your [house key]. Your kitchen is to the SOUTH, and the living room is to the EAST.
The kitchen is small and somewhat dark. Even back when you had electricity, the room wasn't all that impressive. Now, it's essentially useless. All the basics are here (a [refrigerator], a [stove], a [microwave]), but without any electricity they aren't of much use. The SOUTH end of the room contains a small [pantry]. The dining room is to your NORTH.
The End of Days boutique is a dreadfully dreary goth establishment, but it's the nearest [clothing] store to your test site. Even tattered goth stuff has got to be sold on hangers, and there's got to be a wire hanger lurking around here among all the gloom and doom Behind some black curtains to the south is the exit, leading back to the test site.
Theoretically, the vast number of lost socks over the years at the abandoned [laundromat] here will have to eventually reappear. Your experiment is set up, and soon you will see if you can retrieve the socks (hah!) from the entropic plane. The End of Days boutique is further up the [street], to the north.
It is too dark to see clearly. However, you can make out a large [lump] next to you in the gloom.
You have to admit some disappointment. [Harrington] [House] is not nearly as grand as expected. Mother talks about the history contained within its walls, and yes, it's clearly old, but it's unimpressive. From a distance, it looks like an ordinary suburban [bungalow]. Close-up, it simply looks rundown. The front [door] is to the north, and well-kept yards lie to the east and west.
You stand right next to your front [door]. It is blue.
You can see a small rockpool here, with some rocks beside it. On one of the rocks is - wait for it - your [hat]!
The tall, browning grass rustles in the chill wind, but there don't seem to be any flowers to bring a bit of color to the grey surroundings. A cobbled path cuts a narrow slice through the overgrown lawn, leading north to the [house], and another path, branching off of that one, leads around the side of the [house] to the northwest. To the south looms the front [gate].
The old boards of the porch seem to give a little under your feet. To the south, a set of creaking steps leads down to the overgrown, tangled expanse of the lawn; to the north is the front [door] of the house.
The room is nearly bare and quite dim. Shadows have accumulated in the corners. The space is dominated by a large [wooden] [staircase] with a worn, discolored [carpet]; the [stairs] apparently lead to the second storey. There is a [white door] to the east and a [carved wooden] [door] to the west, while the front [door] to the south leads back [outside].
Dark corridors extend east and west from here, and the rickety [staircase] descends to the foyer.
The corridor is narrow and windowless, but a cold draft seems to be creeping in from somewhere - perhaps from the landing to the west. At the end of the corridor is a set of [stairs] leading up.
A small, bare landing, with [stairs] leading down and a single [door] to the west.
The corridor is narrow and windowless, but a cold draft seems to be creeping in from somewhere - perhaps from the landing to the east. There are three [doors] along the north wall. The [first door] is closed, as are the [second and third].
The dusty, weed-spotted [ground] is almost blindingly bright in the [sun]. The [highway] behind you stretches towards town to the south, nowhere to the north. Kind of like your past and future lives. The [Hedge] stands here, green and leafy, tall and expansive, impassible and opaque. A narrow entrance of [arching] stone is set within the [greenery] to the east. The [arch] is guarded by a similarly expansive and impassive [bouncer].
The [Horizon] of Night is a sweet tiny [sailer]. The [keel] hums with power; the [monomolecular] [sails] are reefed and ready. The [compass] spins to the touch of the [Galaxy's] magnetic currents. You have only to weigh [anchor], and leave Myrmidal behind.
A small cavern has formed in the stone, almost as though a bubble of atmosphere was trapped in cooling magma. The [walls] are [dark] grey and eerily smooth, curving down in an egg shape to meet a floor of roughly hewn marble blocks. A glowing [green sphere] is set in the top of the dome, while [water] laps at the sides of [dark pool] in the center of the floor. A [stairway] disappears downward through the floor, the only exit. There is a sense of barely controlled energy pulsing through the room; the [walls], the floor, even the [water] are all warm to the touch.
A bare stone room. A [stairway] leads back up to the sphere and pool room. The [walls] glow with a faint red light. The only exit is back up.
This is the 7th ring of hell. The ground is carpeted with [flowers]. There is a stairwell going down. There are exits to the east and to the west.
This area is small, there are [cubic stones] and a raw [porkchop] here.
Piles of [debris] surround you. Hums, crackles and whirrs emanate producing a peculiar symphony no worse than new age music. [Dust] blows everywhere. Distinguishing your [ship] is a challenge in its own right. But there it is, awaiting your return.
You sit atop a [sleek red wagon]. The [wagon] rumbles forward on the tracks of a [labyrinthine] [roller coaster].
This is the graduate student office you share with [Jim and Molly]. Like pretty much every graduate student office, tiny (way too small for three people to share), windowless, and littered with some random shit -- a [shelf of books], a [typewriter], a [vacuum].
This hallway stretches [out] from east to west, lined with offices; but the only one of interest to you is your own office, to the south.
A round courtyard, paved with large, flat [flagstones]. It's suprisingly peaceful here; at this hour, it's lit by starlight, moonlight, and what looks like the remains of an illegal [campfire] set by some undergrads from the [dorms] to the north.
You stand between the great rolling [sea] to the south and a construction proclaiming itself to be Voodoo Pimp Daddy's House o' Leather, which can be entered to the north.
This large room is extremely difficult to move around in, stuffed as it is with every [leather] item imaginable. [Belts and chairs and jackets and sofas and more] are stacked up and hung from the [ceiling] in an almost random fashion.
Docking [Bay] 3 is the only one with an external [emergency manual release] on the [service hatch], so you could enter without alerting the invaders to your presence. The [service hatch], now safely closed, is above, and below is the portal into the rest of the station. The [controls] for the docking [bay] itself are darkened and dead, and the [docking-bay doors], normally lit for safety purposes, sit impassive and inert.
The polar loop has a [window] on the upper [wall] showing the vast [emptiness] or [space], which is only slightly darker than the corridor itself. Even the emergency lighting seems to be failing here, and you can only barely make out the corridor extending to the north and south.
The polar loop has a [window] on the upper [wall] showing [Earth] below. This corridor has obviously been the scene of a fight: there are scorch marks up and down this north-south corridor, and a sizable hole has been melted in the floor.
The core tunnel is a dreary, purely utilitarian tube. It's uncomfortably small but seems to widen to the west. The tunnel has suffered direct attack directly above, and a hole has been caved into the [ceiling]. The tube also continues, narrowing slightly, to the east, but that passageway seems to be blocked with rubble.
Your sleeping cabin is a small chamber, so as to preserve power during your rest periods. A [sleepnet] in the corner serves to keep you immobile and comfortable while sleeping. Sliding [doors] open to the north and east.
A [mirror], a vacuum [shower], a [closet], and a [waste-management] [unit], all trimmed in an ugly institutional white, serve to meet your basic sanitary needs. Plain unmarked [doors] lead to the south and southeast.
The [bubble-car] is nestled in the docking bay: side views are occluded by parts of the ship's external structure. Above is only the inky blackness of space.
Most of the [controls] in this room evade your understanding: you're a soldier, not a specialist, and the details of Light-Drive technology are hardly part of the general training you've received. Fortunately, the [autopilot] is set up to take you home as soon as you give the command. A [communication] [station and sensor readout] are, unlike the [navigational] [controls], quite within your understanding. A [plaque] hangs over the [door] to the south leading back to the living area. Through a hatch above is the tiny bubble-car used for short-range travel.
The size of the forest to the north is concealed by [two] sheer rockfaces protruding from the northeast and northwest corners of the glade. A thin [curtain of vines] drapes across the opening to the north, giving the impression of a [beaded] screen. The surrounding rockfaces hidden by the [trees], are too steep to climb - the [trees] look unsupportive of attempts to climb them.
The forest retreats into a small clearing here, with a solitary [Holly bush] dominating the centre. The [holly bush] is weighed down with a crop of bright red [berries]. A southeastern path leads back to the edge of the forest, whilst to the north, east and south lie traversible areas of underbrush.
A [hawthorn tree] stands just off to the side of the path, in full bloom. The gnarled trunk gives the [tree] a weathered appearance, whilst an odd scent wafts from its branches, reminiscent of decaying things - no doubt the pollen from its [flowers]. The [tree] stands at a bend in the path, which runs from the north to the west. Impassable undergrowth lies in all other directions.
A pungent aroma floats across the clearing as the warm sunlight hits the leaves of the [juniper bush] growing in the centre of the glade. The path diverges here, leading to the east, north and northeast.
The path terminates here in a shady clearing. The shadows cast by the canopy [above] has enticed a riotous growth of [brambles] to come forth. At the centre of the mass of [brambles] is a small [rose bush], with a single [rose] growing at the top of it. The path leads back [out] of the clearing, to the east.
Your crappy apartment, seen in its entirety. It is fully [furnitured], and there is not much else to say about it. The [exit door] is in the west.
You are standing on the front lawn of Chef Alexander's cottage. The lawn is freshly mowed, and there are some [tulips] growing in a small [flower] garden surrounding the base of the house. It is not gigantic, but surely it's plenty spacious for one man. There is a driveway here and a street to the south. To the north is the entrance into the cottage.
You are underneath the [sofa]. Your [nest] of stolen [socks] is here. Beyond the [sofa] is the living room.
There is a [table] here, the top of which is somewhere high above your head. A length of [black shiny fabric] covers the [table], reaching nearly to the floor. The [sofa] is behind you. A thick white [spiderweb] leads from the floor up to the [window ledge] above you. A [flap] in the front [door] leads [outside] to the porch.
You are standing on the porch in front of the [house]. A [flap] in the front [door] leads back inside. There are a [basket of apples] and a [jack] o' [lantern] here.
You find yourself in a standard classroom complete with [desks, students, blackboard], [teacher]. You recognize it as [Miss Barry's] math class, mostly due to the presence of [Miss Barry]. The doorway leads north.
A strange yet familiar smell is your welcome to the science [lab]. The room contains empty [desks, lab equipment], and a [blackboard]. On one wall hangs a [poster] of the [periodic table] of the [elements], on another there is a [framed newspaper].
You stand in the middle of a long, curving hallway. You can return to the main part of the school by following the curve to the northeast or southeast. Various [classes] are in session up and down the hall, but the music room is open to the west.
You stand in the middle of a long hallway running east and west. [Lockers] lining [both] sides of the hall are interrupted by various [classroom entrances], the most important to you being Miss Barry's room to the south.
The hallway widens here and becomes the entryway for the school. A [large mural] has been [painted] on the [windows] of the classroom to the north, meant to be the first thing seen upon coming through the main [doors] to the south. You can enter the offices to the southeast or wander the halls by going either west or northeast.
This little office is the haven of one [Dean Larsen]. She has a [desk], some [filing cabinets], and a [dying plant].
Large and flat, the roof spans the area of the school. A [ledge] rises up around the [perimeter] to offer some protection for those stumbling around up here.
This cool, quiet space is perfect for study. [Chairs and tables] have been set up in the middle of the room, while [row] after [row of shelves] hold a great [collection of books].
You are in your comfortable tunnel like hall. In fact, it's just a dirty hole in the ground, but to you it's home. [Gandalf] is working on a nasty [spell]. There is a round, green [door] set in the eastern wall.
You are standing in a vast clearing, with paths leading off to the east and west. A yellow-brick road leads north. [Trolls] are standing all around you, fiercely watching every move of your limbs.
[Cannon] Emplacement This is a [cannon] emplacement complete with a Civil War-style [cannon] and a neatly stacked pyramid of [cannon balls].
[Cliff] This [cliff] affords the same spectacular view as from the cannon emplacement above. Far below you and stretching east, are the white sands of a beach, illuminated by the moon's glow.
Nearby in the [ground] is a closed [hatch].
This is the southeastern corner of a large backyard whose main feature is an elaborate [garden].
This is a rickety landing at the top of a long flight of old, wooden [stairs] leading down to the beach far below.
You're about halfway down the steep [staircase], which creaks under your weight.
You are falling towards the ground. You can see some [clouds] and the [sun].
The classroom is quiet now. The quiet has the frayed edges that indicate tumult and excitement just a few doors away. The lights are low. The [metal] walls of the classroom rise, bending at precise yet inexplicable angles as they are lost in the [darkness] forty, sixty, one-hundred feet overhead.
Midway between the dark, twisting corridors of the High School to the west, and the spacious extravagance of the Mathedral to the east. The [ceiling] is a high, reversed ravine crosshatched with light and spiny shadows.
A [chaos] of knees and elbows. The average [person] in this [crowd] seems to have, on average, five such protruding joints, and [each] attached appendage is flailing and threshing as the [crowd] packs itself tighter.
When empty, you love the lower [nave]: mathematical branching [archways, buttress] building upon [buttress]. When it is packed as full as a magnet-tram at rush-hour--only without the motion towards home--not so much.
The east wall leans west, the south wall leans south, and the north and west walls are crooked in angular S-curves. There is a narrow gap in the north wall, and just through it, a hint of descending [steps]. The narthex is back to the west.
Though maybe it used to be a [crossway], with four brick tunnels branching [out] beneath a [groined vault], now only the northwestern and southwestern passages are open. The others have collapsed and are full of broken [bricks]. A [staircase] heads upwards.
Fragments of [brick] stick from the walls and ceiling like snaggle-teeth. The ground is a thick [carpet of dust], soft under your feet. The tunnel bends here, [heading] northeast and southeast.
A rutted ground of rotted [bricks]. The ceiling is low, lumpy with whitish nitre. The walls are very close and crooked, but not by any mysterious robot design. They're just ancient--and were shoddy to begin with. Brick passageways lead southeast and northwest.
And here, the rotten [brick] floor has partially collapsed--there appears to be a level below the crypt. You could probably climb down to it if you really wanted to...
This was probably a culvert once. Muddy, dim. Just breathing the air here is like kissing a grave. The bowed [ceiling], which curves down to become the walls, is riddled with [fissures], from which protrude [dead black roots].
Not much light at all, just a few knife-edges of shuttered candle gleam coming from the hodge-podge of alleys and [houses]. You are appalled that people could possibly be allowed to live down here.
A cramped stone cubicle. The walls are shaggy with cancer-like scales of [soot]. An [iron basket of smoldering] [dirt] clods hangs from the ceiling. The air, mostly smoke, stinks like the filth of millennia.
In front of you and to the north is a split level [house]. To your left is a stone driveway which ends in a [garage].
The [side] of the [house] is to your west. A worn [sidewalk] and steps lead up to a [door]. In front of you was once a gate to the backyard. Now all that is left is a cylindrical metal fence post.
You are standing in the [backyard]. Next to the [door] is a worn out patio and a crumbling brick barbeque. The rest of the yard has patches of grass and several tall trees.
The [small jail] cell is brick on three sides, metal [bars] on the other, with a tightly [locked] [gate]. A [small window] is set into the [brickwork] above your head. Through the [jail bars] you can see the sheriff's [office].
A long sandy beach stretches out to either side. Just off shore floats an [iceberg].
The [attic] of the house, filled with [useless crap]. A [desk] on the west [wall] is home to a [computer], numerous [disks and CDs, boxes and pens]. On the left side of the [desk] is a [bookshelf], and on the right side a [drawer], and next to the [drawer] is a [waist-high] [cabinet]. A [bed] lies by the east [wall]. There is a [small], knee-[high shelf] under the [window]. Northwest is an alcove, the stairs are north.
You are standing on a flight of [stairs] going down to the second floor.
A small [alcove], filled with [Barbie dolls and accessories]. East leads to the stairs, and southeast to the main portion of the attic.
A [hallway] extending south. Your feet are cushioned by a [soft gray carpet]. Doors are in the north and east [walls]. A stairwell leads back up to the attic.
Your aunt's and uncle's [bedroom]. The [bed] takes up most of the room, with a [nightstand] on [each] side. A [table] on the south [wall] is home to a small [television], and a [VCR].
This your cousin Sam's [bedroom]. Against the east [wall] is a [bunk bed]. Resting beside the north [wall] are a [bookshelf] and a [desk], and there is a closet in the south [wall].
A [bathroom] with yellow [walls] and floor. A [sink] is by the south [wall], a [toilet] next to it, and a [bathtub] opposite it. A [towel rack] is on the west well next to the tub.
The [dining room] of the house. The [table] in the center of the [room] is surrounded by six chairs. An elaborate [Lego] setup is arranged on a [table] by the east [wall]. An open space north leads to the living [room], and a doorway leads south.
North leads to the dining room, and a there is a door in the northwest [wall].
You are at the top of a flight of [stairs]. You may go back up to the kitchen or further downwards to the [basement]. There is a [light switch] in the [wall] next to you.
All that's unpacked in the room is your [mattress] with a [sheet] thrown over the top of it. Your dresser is still in storage. [Windows] look [out] to the north and west, and the [closet] lies to the south.
Peeling paint greets you as you gaze down the hallway. Once you get moved in and get your car back, a trip to the paint store is on your list of things to do. The threadbare carpet leads you south, or you can step into your [bedroom] to the west. The [bathroom] lies to the north, and there's a [spare bedroom] to the east.
Hardwood floors greet you and your steps echo as you walk around the [room]. There is a [window] in the west wall looking [out] into the front yard. The front [door] is to the west, and the kitchen lies to the east.
The concrete is cracked but is still servicable to park your [car]. The garage itself lies to the east, but there's no handle on this side of the garage door. Add a trip to the hardware store to your list of things to do.
A small [kitchen], perfect for one. [Cupboards] line the north wall, and there's a refigerator in the corner next to the [oven]. Oh, and there's also a [kitchen sink]. You can walk west to the living room, or east down [some] steps into the sun room.
A vast open room at the back of the [house] with [windows] on all sides. A [door] looking [something] like one you'd see on a [barn] leads [outdoors], while the garage is to the southwest. The kitchen is up [some] steps to the west.
Obviously this garage was built many years ago because there's no way the modern car would fit in it. As a result, it becomes a convenient place to store your stuff when you get it [out] of storage. The garage door lies to the east, but it's locked shut and the realtor forgot to give you the [key] to the padlock. Another chore for you after moving in.
You didn't have the willpower to go [out] this morning: today is one of the hottest days of the month, the air is so damp it seems viscous and the bed appears to you as a valid alternative to anything. Despite all that, here you are on the street, an easy target for the sun. And who's guilty of it? Your friend Julius - damn it all! - asked you to deliver a message... Right now, the only thing you can do is read the note Julius left, deliver the message and then head back home...
You have the good fortune to live in a fine [avenue] with a lot of [trees], which line the [road] to the north and end in a [square]: the [maritime pines] which adorn the [avenue] create a natural barrier between the [road] and the [canal] skirting it, guaranteeing a little [shade]. The sole flaw is a multitude of [mosquitos], which have made the [canal] their [home].
A little [square] where [roads] from the four cardinal directions meet. The [square], which contains a feebly-[spurting] [fountain], is very [crowded] today, because of the [weekly market] in the northern and eastern [roads].
A woman beats a carpet on the second floor of the [building] near to you.
In this [street] there are a lot of [buildings], which provide shelter from the wind and almost guarantee a little shade. In addition to the great number of [houses], there is also a [pub] when you often spend your evenings and a [stationer's] [shop] where you bought pens and pencils in times of low school.
"My InitQuips should be overloaded," says the shopgirl. ([BUG])
You have the luck to live in a fine [avenue] with a lot of [trees], which conduct to north in a [square]: the [maritime pines] which adorn the [avenue] create a natural barrier between the [road] and the [canal] that skirt, guaranteeing a little [shade]. The sole flaw is the multitude of [mosquitos], which fixed in the [canal] their headquarter. From a near [building] you hear a man and a woman quarrel screaming.
A woman beats a carpet in the second floor of the [building] near to you.
A little [square] from that branch off [four roads], which conduct to the [four] cardinal [ways]. The [square], which accommodate a [fountain] with a feeble [spurt], today is very [crowded], because there's the [weekly market] in the northern and eastern [road].
In this [street] there are a lot of [buildings], that - though impede the transit of the wind - almost guarantee a little shade. In this [road], in addiction to the great number of [houses], there are also a [pub] when you often spend your evenings and a [stationer's] [shop] where you bought pens and pencils in times of low school.
A small [stream] flows [out] of the [building] through a pair of one-foot [pipes] and down a [gully] to the south. Next to the [door] of the [building], there is a [faded sign].
At your feet all the [water] of the stream splashes into a [[two]-inch] [slit] in the rock.
A [road] slopes down the side of the hill to the east. There is a small brick building in the distance at the end of the [road].
You are in an open [forest], with a deep valley to one side. You see a piece of [crumpled paper] here.
You are inside a small building, a well house for a large [spring]. The [stream] bubbles up [out] of the [ground] and flows [out] the [side] of the building through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer [pipes]. The word "THURB" has been painted on one of the [pipes]. There is a [doorway] in the middle of the north wall. A huge [steel safe] has been installed into the brick wall on the east wall.
You are in a small, low-[ceilinged] room with the words
You are in open [forest] near [both] a valley and a road.
You are in the midst of a thick [woods]. The [ground] is damp with dew. The air is chilly and you shiver from the cold. The only path leads south -- back the way you came. You see thousands of [leaves] here as well.
You are perched somewhat precariously on a limb near the top of a tall tree. Far [above] you can see what looks like a [bird's nest]. However, it is [out] of your reach and you can not climb any higher.
City Hall teleported you here to [Shalestorm] [Shingle] mainly for the drama of the name. Small [rocks and stones] litter the ground here, but it dissolves to good clean [sand] a little ways to the south.
The rocky beach from the north tapers off a bit; down here, closer to the [water], the [rocks] have been worn down to [black sand]. To the west is the [ocean] itself; the [sand] gives way to [concrete] to the south.
The [containment] [field] makes a sharp turn here, blocking travel to the south as well as the east. [Metallic wreckage] is strewn throughout this corner of the beach. Possibly this is the work of Dr. Sinister on his latest rampage, but you suspect that this is actually what's left of some [innocent building] torn apart by the creation of the [containment] [field].
This small nook functions as your [bedroom] here onboard ship. Exit to the north.
This is a tiny little room full of all kinds of [electronic] and flashing equipment. Exit north.
This is the location from which [flight] control and communications tasks can be performed. Exit is west
[Outside] the bar where you hang [out]. It's a busy north-south street with a lot of people that you don't care about. Your second favorite place is the taco stand to the east, across the street.
You're in the middle of the road. Without even looking, the "lady" [drivers] all slow down and wait expectantly for your next move. The non-lady [drivers] throw up their hands in confusion.
In front of the [taco stand] where you hang [out]. You know the menu by heart. There are [ladies] here.
This is the front bar of your favorite watering hole. There's a disco to the right, a pool hall to the left, and a banquet room with tables in the back where people hang [out].
The banquet room is a large room for paid gatherings. Tonight it's just a hang [out].
You've had a long day. All you want to do is climb into [bed]. But why is your [pillow] quivering like that?
You're sitting in your lifeless [car] on a desolate [roadside], a good half-hour drive away from the last [gas] station you passed. It's at least a hundred and [twenty] degrees [outside] -- not uncommon in the Doradan [desert], even in November -- and the heat is quickly becoming unbearable. The [key] is in the [ignition], if you [care].
All the closed places provide shelter for the people from the rain. In days like this, coffee houses are more crowded than ordinary days. People talk to [each] other and there is a humming sound in the place. The music is some old school rock'n roll.
You're sitting atop a [pile of corpses] in some sort of open-topped [cylinder], with smooth [white walls]. All you can see is a small [light] above you. It hurts your eyes.
You're elevated now, on something flat. It's not as cold as [ice], not as slippery as a rock.
You are lying prone on the inside of an all black [cylinder]. This area is cramped with only a minimum of room to move about. You see a small [sensor panel] located on the inside of the [cylinder]. Directly [above] you is a small [window] set into the [frame] of the tube. The [cryotube] is currently closed.
The [Senator] didn't seem to believe in much luxury. Her [bedroom] is furnished in a spare, ultramodern style. A [large platform bed] fills the center of the room, flanked by a [black dresser] along one [wall]. A [wide mirror] hangs over the [dresser]. The north [wall] is dominated by a [vast window], which was your original point of entry. The master bathroom is to the south, and a walk-in closet is visible to the west. A [door] to the east has a thin [line of light] showing beneath it. You can see a [touch panel] on the [wall], next to the [doorway].
A bathroom, nicely complimenting the ultramodern style in the master bedroom. Featured in brushed chrome and gleaming [white porcelain], the fixtures [look] almost like showroom models. You can see a [sink] with a [vanity mirror] above it, a [toilet], a [bathtub], and a [towel bar] with a [fluffy white towel] on it.
A walk-in closet, filled with women's [suits], snappy [casual clothes], and some expensive [formalwear]. The back [wall] boasts a [large rack] of expensive [shoes]. A small [switch] is next to the door.
I'm still sitting on the [stool], fingertips poised to grasp [chicken strips] and punch in [numbers] on the [register]. Really though it's so quiet I mostly just look [out] the [window]. The [big clock] above the [intercom speakers] ticks slowly.
I'm still sitting on the [stool], fingertips poised to grasp bags of [pre-cut oven] fires and punch in [numbers] on the [register].
You are standing before a grreat tunnle of glass, in wich [sharks] are. There are exits to the west and east.
You are standing before a tunnle. A glass wall seperates the sharks from this room. There are multiple types of [fish] swiming in the tunnle.
Your [tracks] lead through the [snow] back into the distance. Everywhere else is blank and undefined; the [sky] and the [ground] are one solid, [flat] plane ahead of you.
I look around more carefully at the [station]; no matter how many times I've been here, it always seem like there's a [new] detail, a [new] subtle feature when I look. Perhaps it just a matter of the times, now, though, that everywhere I look I see nothing [new]. [Everything] I see is as it was before. Stagnation. It's in the air; not death and decay--though that is surely coming--but the absolute lack of change.
The [walls] are flat [white], save for [four [paintings]] along the south [wall, each] centered under its own [spotlight]. The rest of the museum lies through a pair of [double doors] to the north.
This is the entrance to the [Master MIAGE].
You stand in the [Master MIAGE] Hallway, long and sinister like a hospital, there is no decoration. Where you would normally expect this hallway to be crowded with students and teachers, you see no one.
The room is pitch black. No one is in here and, as you squint your eyes, you make [out] a stairway that seems to be going down, it definitely wasn't there before. There are drops of blood on the first steps.
You're among the Great [Planes] of Calembour. [Planes] from all stages of history and possibly the future surround you. A [path] winds through them towards the south.
You are at a [crossroads]. The Great Planes are north, a [bar] is to the east and [paths] continue to the south and west.
You arrive at an intersection with [paths] leading north, south, east and wes... whoa, hold up, there are totally some [naked chicks] here!
A flock of wristwatches flaps across the [sky]. Time sure flies here!
You are standing [outside] the entrance to a [cave]. A very mopey aura exudes from its [innards]. This feeling gets you rather down which, quite frankly, is rather inconsiderate of the [cave]. No, don't make excuses for it. It's selfish.
You have entered the lair of [Salazar], the legendary [hermit]. He sits in the middle of the [cavern], looking like a gigantic pile of misery. [Drawings] cover the [walls].
You walk onto what appears to be a film production [set], complete with [cameras and lights] pointing into a room missing a fourth [wall]. The [set] appears to replicate a kitchen. A feeling of danger is in the air. [Paths] lead east and northeast.
"Can you please take my [picture], if it's not too much [bother]?"
You're standing in the shadow of a gigantic [apple]. A [path] runs from east to west.
The [tourist] shrugs his shoulders and continues to snap [pictures].
You're on a [road] that runs north and south. Loud, abrasive noise is coming from the southern [path].
You're standing in an empty car [park]. A [path] leads west while [desert] extends in all other directions.
High winds send [sheets of rain] against the [canopy], turning the [outside] world into shades of [misty gray and deep black shadows]. Inside, [lights] blink all across on your [console] - never a good sign.
You have a [small metal desk] by the wall, a [bed] in one corner, and a [closet] in another.
Your [Tent] (You are in the army [cot].)
Your [Tent] You are in your [tent].
Outside Your [Tent] You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment.
Lying in the [sand] is a wooden packing [crate].
Outside Supply [Tent] You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment.
Fire [Pit] You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred [pit], a [hole] dug in the [sand] surrounded by blackened [rocks]. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the [desert, covering] most of the [pit's] bottom. You can see your [tent] to the north, the work [tent] to the south, and the supply [tent] to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting [sands], you can see gentle, rolling dunes.
Southern Path You are at the west edge of an east/west path on the southern side of the encampment. Directly to the west is a heavy growth of [thickets], making any attempt at western movement a painful and futile task. Through the [thickets] you can hear the sound of water running gently by.
[Desert] You are in the [desert], a vast wasteland of [sand] and heat.
A small lizard pokes its head up from the [sands] and asks the shortest route to Times Square. You scratch your head for a moment and when you remember the proper subway [line] to recommend to it, you notice it's disappeared.
A strong gust of wind kicks up a herd of [buffalo] on the horizon. You think it strange that the [buffalo] are riding sidesaddle.
You think you see a spaceship settling on the horizon and, as you strain your eyes through the wafting waves of heat, you see a man and a huge robot. You can almost hear them saying "[Gort, Klaatu] Barada Nikto."
You hear a whirring overhead and look up in time to see a gyrocopter settling to the [sand] on the horizon.
You are in the [desert], a vast wasteland of sand and heat.
You are at the start of a path which heads north along the eastern border of the encampment. To the east you can see the horror and the beauty which brought you here, the [desert] sand and its hidden treasure. The firepit is visible to the northwest.
You are in the [desert], east of the encampment. From this distance the camp seems little more than a mirage, an image of another reality which has little to do with the brutal, searing reality of the [desert], your quickly dehydrating body, or your painfully broiling feet.
You are far into the [desert], sand and more sand stretching out endlessly around you in all directions. You think of going [back], of giving up this attempt at riches, but what awaits you [back] in the States? What is there worth going [back] to, with nothing to show for this quest? And how could you go [back] now, after the things you'd said to Craige? You glance around at the rolling dunes and force [back] the fear eating away your confidence.
You are standing on the top of a sand dune, looking all around at a place on Earth where man was never meant to be. That is the only conclusion you can draw as you force yourself to breathe the hot, arid [air] of the [desert] through your nose. Breathing through your mouth makes you instantly thirsty, a dangerous state to find yourself in while surrounded by sand. You curse Craige, then find yourself cursing Ellingsworth, too.
You are deep into the [desert], as deep as anyone in his right mind would ever care to venture. A small but strong gust of wind reaches your face, pelting you with grains of sand so small they remind you of fine sugar. Even with your lips tightly closed, the wind manages to drive a few grains into your mouth. You are thankful that none got into your eyes. There's a sizable [hole] in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
You are standing in an open [field] west of a [white house]. The front [door] is not boarded up; there is no need. To the right of the [door] is a small [window], apparently a recent remodel, which is slightly ajar.
A geometric [laser interferometer] spans the [slit]. Just as you remember from your long-ago first adventure, the [slit] remains exactly two inches wide. You could be here a long time.
Computer Room Banks of [computers] line the walls, covered with little [flashing lights]. There is also a fairly standard looking computer [terminal and screen] nestled in amongst the outlandish technological wizardry. More prosaically, there is a [door] to the south.
Banks of [computers] line the walls, covered with little [flashing lights].
The six [walls] are [metal]. This is a box in which nothing happens but people talk, and [fans] whir air in and out to help the words move along. By the [door] in the north wall is a small [red button] that rings the [buzzer] for the guard, and it's smart enough to know who's pushing. This isn't a place people leave of their own accord, and they rarely come here that way either.
Your [car] is parked at a slight angle at the end of the long [drive], its nose almost poking into a purple-leaved [bush]. A [dusty] wake is gradually settling on the long [track] behind. Mackenzie's [bubble] is to the east, its [door] closed. The [road] leads right up to it, with no front garden.
The bathroom lies to the west and the front [door] lies to the south and leads to the parking lot.
There are rows of cars, [each] belonging to a different person. To the east is the Business Center, where your workplace is and the north to get back into your apartment. You meet your [neighbor].
You see a [homeless] man and a young [socialite]. To the north is the Business Center.
A [door] blocks the hallway to the east. And a [dresser] stands next to the [bed]...
The Stanselton City Bus Stops aren't the best in the world, but they get the job done pretty well, with a sturdy [metal bench] and a firm [steel enclosure].
From the entry a rich blue [carpet] runs up a ramp into the dim interior of the [bridge]. A [view screen] on the far wall shows the [outside] of the [ship]. Banks of [consoles] line the walls. A single [chair] sits in the center of the room. You grip your [sword, Night], tightly in your hand.
A cramped metal [space], with no room for niceties. A [control yoke fires] left or right thrusters, a [weapons console] launches precious ordnance. Between the two, a [viewport] opens on the [stars].
There is a large [desk] here, along with a few [chairs and couches]. The [presidential] [seal] is in the middle of the room and there is a full-length [mirror] upon the [wall].
The [lights] of this room are styled to resemble warm, yellow lamplight, and are low enough to leave the corners in [shadow]. A [window] looks out over your lawn, though it is now obscured by sheets of splattering [rain]. Nestled within the glow of light is a [cozy chair] pulled up to an ancient-looking [wooden desk].
Concrete [walls], gray for the most part. Some panels here and there, covered with a plethora of buttons and [lights]. The place has nothing to be liked for. It's nothing more than one of the biggest Boondoggle of the century! Here lies your [desk] and your favorite chair, and a frozen [alien twenty] meters ahead of you, protected by several [security devices]. The main exit is south, but you're supposed to stay here the whole night! There are some other [rooms] east and west, but without any TV they are just boring and useless places.
[Hilltop] You're on a [hilltop] overlooking the seaside [village] of Festeron.
Post [Office] This is the [lobby] of the Festeron Post [Office].
You can see a mysterious [envelope] on the service [counter].
Outside [Cottage] You're outside the [cottage] of Miss [Voss], the [town] librarian.
Outside [Cemetery] You're standing next to an open iron [gate] that leads west into the Festeron [Cemetery].
The dimly lit [cell] section is not easy on the eyes, or on the nose. Small [jail cells] line the [walls]; most of them are empty. The only exit lies to the east.
The [police] station is surprisingly quiet at this hour. The air is stagnant in the lobby. Interesting things don't generally happen in this part of the city.
The police [station] of this district is one of the quietest in the city. The Brenett University is nearby so people who get arrested are usually drunken students, but now it's the Professor who is sitting in the jail. The [station doors] are to the north.
The main room of the [religious building], this [sanctuary] was designed beauty first, comfort last. [Giant pillars] dominate this [great hall, ornately sculpted] but partially blocking most views to the [altar]. [Intriguingly] [magnificent] [windows] are set in [alcoves] which distort and reflect all sound. A [majestic carpet] rolls down the [middle aisle], but apparently no one is allowed to walk on it. Blending into the back of the [sanctuary] looms a [balcony] complete with [organ], although the [organ] hasn't been played today and you don't see anyone sitting up there.
You are standing on a small wooden [quay] on the shore of an unknown [island]. Actually, the whole [island] is a sole high [mountain] protruding [out] of the [sea]. A [path] starts from the [quay] and continues uphill until it ends at the base of [stairs] climbing the side of the [mountain]. Some [vegetation] grows on the lower slopes of the [mountain], near the shore.
The [examination] [room] is bright, almost painfully bright. A fluorescent [bulb] burns overhead, bathing the [room] in white [light], shining off of the white [walls]. A [lightbox] with an [x-ray image] on it hangs on one [wall]. Next to the [examination] [table] is a metal [trolley], covered in assorted implements.
You are in the company break room, complete with the employee [fridge], where you could store your lunch, if you had a lunch. Access corridors lead north, south, east, and west. Your supply closet is to the northwest, and the receptionist's office is to the northeast. Next to the [safety and motivational] [posters], a pin-up [calendar] adorns the dingy [wall], currently displaying Ms. July.
[Access door E1S] is here, standing open. [Access door E1N] is here, standing open.
You are in [Access] Corridor E1, which leads east and west from here. You can see the break room to the west, and the smell of stale snack foods and burnt coffee is strangely appealing. The fluorescent [lights] above you flicker irregularly, dimly illuminating the [doors] to the north and south.
[Access door E2S] is here, standing open. [Access door E2N] is here, standing open.
You are in [Access] Corridor E2, which leads east and west from here.
[Access door E3S] is here, standing open. [Access door E3N] is here, standing open.
[Access door W3S] is here, standing open. [Access door W3N] is here, standing open.
[Access door W2S] is here, standing open. [Access door W2N] is here, standing open.
[Access door W1S] is here, standing open. [Access door W1N] is here, standing open.

[Access door N3E] is here, standing open. [Access door N3W] is here, standing open.
This office is an interesting combination between Art Deco and the fads of the 80's. At least all the earth tones were taken out during the last remodeling. The [vast cherrywood] [doors] to the north lead to your boss's office; they are illuminated by [lamps] which were probably tasteful at least briefly during the 70's. The smell of stale coffee comes from the southwest.
[Access door S1E] is here, standing open. [Access door S1W] is here, standing open.
[Access door S3E] is here, standing open. [Access door S3W] is here, standing open.
[Access door S2E] is here, standing open. [Access door S2W] is here, standing open.
This shack has seen better days. The floor is warped, rippling the surfact of the large [faded oriental carpet] that covers half of the room; the rest is aged [pine] floorboards.
You are flying past the general seating area. The [rabble] shouts with excitement and throws peanuts and epithets. The [wizards'] section is [ahead], the [Beast Pens] are [behind] you.
You are near the [ceiling]. There is a platform here, which continues [behind] you. [Ahead] is empty air.
You are on a narrow stony platform the arena [mechanics] can pull out or replace as the match requires. This one extends [behind] you.
You are standing on a lonely [street] in New York, feeling the chill of the foggy night air cut through your thin [jacket] and move down deep inside your bones. The [bulb] in a nearby [street lamp] flickers on and off. To the west is the front door of an apartment building. South of here is a narrow alleyway shrouded in unsettling darkness. The sidewalk continues east and north.
The front [door] of the building gives you the shivers and you aren't sure why. Perhaps it is the false promise of safety. The [black paint] peels in [jagged strips], and the [inset window] is too filthy to see through. A [panel] with numbered [buttons] is set in the [wall] next to the [door].
The alleyway is not the place to be on a night like this. You can barely see to walk, and after a few steps in you cannot go forward safely without using your [hands] to guide you. A [hulking dumpster, reeking] of ancient [garbage], nestles in the darkness. The alley continues south into pitch darkness, and the sidewalk is back north.
You are sitting at a tiny [bar], and you are the only customer here. This is a small corner [pub], a room with four [tables and chairs] at them. And there is the [bar] with a [set of beer taps]. There is a [bowl] on the [counter]. You can see [saltsticks] in that [bowl]. Your [empty glass] sits on the [counter] in front of you.
You can feel that you are surrounded by [cold metal].
You thought this moment would be more emotional, cathartic even. But standing there - smoking gun in hand, with your quarry finally dead at your feet - you feel curiously empty. Well, perhaps you just need time to let what you have done and what it means sink in. But time is certainly not a luxury you have right now. The shot will have been heard, and the police will have been called. The one thing working in your favor might be that the [apartment] you rented for the occasion is just a few blocks up the street. Keep your friends close and you enemies closer, as they say. You never did waste much thought on what would happen...after, but maybe you do have a chance to get back home and make some plans. Maybe. Not much of a chance probably, but right now it is all you have.
His apartment is small and sparsely furnished. A [sofa] stands in front of a small TV. The [door] is to the south.
This is the street [outside] his [apartment building]. The brick and [brownstone] facade stretches up above you. A short [flight of stairs] lead up to the front [door], next to which is a [speaker-phone]. The street leads west from here, towards your own [apartment building].
You're standing between two nondescript apartment [buildings]. Your own building is just two blocks west up the street from here. A narrow [alley] leads north into shadow.
This is one of many offices in [Kentish] Plover, a micro enterprise that creates interactive fiction. While your office is small, the building that houses the business is about the size of a supermarket. The room is comfortable, with a [desk] and a door to the east.
The [water] continues everywhere, moving here and there. Up high, the [sun] casts a shining light that prevents you from looking up.
You are standing in a field of [grass]. Nothing but shimmering, green blades of [grass] as far as the eye can see.
A clean and sterile place, with [many] [instruments] to poke and prod you. A [door] leads west.
What a place! [Pristine, golden-white litter] stretches out endlessly in all directions.
This is a startlingly disorganized [office]. Beneath the [mountains of papers, computer manuals and discarded junk food containers] you can barely make out a dented metal [desk]. The only exit from the clutter is to the east.
This short hall in the [Computer] Center continues to the south. Your office is to the west. There is a heavy [door] to the north, protected with a [card reader]. There is a [sign] above the north [door].
The main terminal room of Kook U's College of Computer Science is filled with [terminals], personal [computers, workstations] and other [computing equipment], all being used by university [students and faculty]. A small hall leads north and the building's exit is to the south.
The "[Challenge]" camp is set up just north of [Krakatoa's] southern lagoon. Deep forest separates you from the smoking [volcano] to the north, and other paths lead west, northwest, northeast, and east.
A [grassy] meadow covers this corner of the island. That seems plausible, right? At any rate, several [sheep and cows] are here, taking advantage of the [grass] and eating their full. Hills are to the north, towards the [volcano], and the camp lies east.
Nice [sandy] [beach]. Shame you don't have time to just sit down and enjoy it.
This natural [lagoon] is a perfect place for [fishing]. You wish your friend Harley was here. Harley loved to go [fishing] with you when you were kids. The camp is visible to the north, and the beach extends west and east, and of course the [ocean] fills your view south, all the way to the horizon.
You're in a deep [forest] with lots of those really [tall trees] with no climbable [branches] in reach.
You've entered the best [bakery] on Krakatoa. The only [bakery] on Krakatoa. There's a [sign] on the [wall], and the exit is south.
You can easily believe you're far from home. You can't see much except for [trees, trees], and more [trees] in all directions, but at least they provide [some] welcome shade.
You're climbing the side of the [volcano]. There's not much here but [volcanic rock]. You can head further up to the north, or go down into the forest to the south.
Wow. You're standing on a tiny ledge on the rim, or lip of the [volcano]. The [smoke] is blowing into your face, and you can see molten [lava] far below. Needless to say, it's extremely hot here, and quite a bit dangerous.
The room is a perfect cube, about 30 feet on a side. The [ceiling] is yellow and the floor is purple. The north wall is blue, and the eastern wall is green. To the south, the wall is orange, and the western wall is red. The walls are bare of ornament, and no furniture occupies the room.
A small, circular room, carved [out] of the depths of the [Mother Tree]. What little light there is trickles in from a long hallway to the north.
From this vantage point, you can see most of the north face of your [Mother Tree]. Far above you is Citadel Bleph, founded by your own great ancestors generations ago. Far below, all details of the surface are lost to haze. You can vaguely discern the great Milk Sea, and the Rainbow Spot within it.
This building is dominated by enormous [telescopes] and other optical instruments, all pointed across The Great Gap. No signal from the Lower Forest has been received for generations, yet the scientists live in hope. Indeed, it is to them you owe your mission, for it was they who spotted the asteroid plummeting downwards. The asteroid you are now sworn to retrieve.
This building is among the lowest on the [Mother Tree], although it remains safely above the surface. The research [pod] is here, waiting to take you down to the surface, where you are expected to retrieve the asteroid.
The research pod is incredibly cramped. There's just enough room for two [levers]: one labeled DOWN and the other UP. There's also a small [window].
Strands of light filter down as though through a liquid sieve. The [water] is pleasantly warm after a long day of equatorial sun.
The [water] here is colder than at the surface, and the twisted towers of [kelp] sway in a slow current, tangling and masking your rising [hose]. The [boat] is just barely visible -- a small black flaw in a span of sapphire.
Luminescent [polyps] line the [walls] of this tight [crevice]. Their delicate [fronds] wave in the icy [water]. You would be nearly blind without their weak colored light.
Between the [rock ceiling and white sand] floor hangs three feet of inky [water] filled with bustling movement. At the back of the cave you can see a [monstrous whiskered shape, scarred and heavy]. It is surrounded by a [swarm] of small, [brightly colored fish].
The [spider crab] holds you in three of its [legs]. They circle your abdomen, chest, and knees. The spurs on the [crab's] [legs] press into you painfully. Through the great limbs, you feel a gentle, rhythmic vibration, as of a slow hearbeat.
It is very noisy here, because of all the [sheep] bleating. Near the [corner] of the [field], a [sign] points south down a [track].
A long, winding [track] ends here and a [stile] continues east into a [field]. A [shortcut] to the farm leads back [north-west]. In the [field] you can see a [large, fierce bull].
This is the [track] leading west back to the farm, and east on to the creamery.
This is the [track] leading north back to the farm, and east on to the creamery.
You're standing on a gently sloping [hill] near a popular Parisian [park]. To the north you can see lots of [people] enjoying the summer day. Those without [parasols] sit in the shade of [beautiful] green [trees], and in light of the way you're feeling, you might want to follow their lead. It's slightly after noon and the [sun] is beating down on you.
It's nice and shady here. An upper-class [Frenchwoman] and her male [companion] (complete with [monocle], top hat, and riding crop) are standing here, staring off to the west. The [river] does look nice, but the persistence of their gaze is unnerving. You can see a [woman] knitting to the west and a girl holding a bouquet to the north.
There's a [girl] here, about [thirteen] years old, arranging [flowers]. There's a [finished bouquet] next to her, and her [mother] (or aunt, or whatever) sits nearby, gazing at the [Seine]. Exits are north, toward a little [girl] and her [mother], south, where an aristocratic couple walk a pet monkey, and west, toward an open field.
There's not much here besides grass. A nice view of the [Seine] lies to your west. There's an obnoxious [bugler] to the north, and you don't like the idea of hearing his warbling tune at a higher volume. Thus, you can only go east or south from here.
A [woman] sits here [knitting] a delicate white garment. She appears to be accompanied by a mustached [man] with a top [hat and cane] who looks across the [river]. Nearby a [boatman] smokes a [pipe] and stares [out] into the [Seine] as well. An unoccupied grassy patch of land lies to the north, and to the east you spot an aristocratic couple with a monkey.
There's a [little girl] here, holding her [mother's] hand. Other [people] are to the north, but there's nothing interesting in that direction, so you can only return south from here.
All that [remains] of the [bridge] is a few [splintered] [posts and planks] clinging sadly to [both banks] of the [river]. The [town] is to the north, [across] the [river].
It starts to get [marshy] here, but drier land is upstream to the west.
The [scrub brush] along the [river] is dense here, but it thins [out] downstream to the east.
You are standing in the extremely well-equipped [control] room of your spaceship, which reflects the increase in your wealth following your last adventure. The only exit is north to the cargo hold. Your [robot dog] is sitting here. [Petrov], your [navigator], is standing alertly here. [Dimi], your [engineer], is here. [Kara], your [second-in]-command, is with you. Your [console] area is to one side, apparently operating perfectly. The main [control button] awaits your use. [Dimi and Kara] run into the cargo hold to check check out the engines. The [dog] stands by, uncertain. Before you can react, the ship lurches suddenly as the ground moves beneath it. The [control] room end tilts downwards, and the cargo hold end is thrown upwards. [Dimi] is thrown backwards through the [hatch] into the [control] room, and the [hatch] slams shut in a horrid jammed sort of way.
An awful hammering and screaming comes from the other side of the [hatch]!
Well, it's private, at least. They assured you of this. It's a crumbly gray hole dug into a gray [field], yes, and the air's choked with [dust]. You can't move without kicking up a new [cloud] and blinding [yourself] for a few seconds, not that there'd be much to miss. But at least people can't see you here. Even if someone down below were to look at the [sky] when you were [out] of your trench, they'd merely see a shiny speck. Windows get them all the time.
They name everything up here like they would down below. So this area, silent and blank in all directions, they call a field, despite the lack of vegetation. There's nothing around under the horizon but gray [dirt], and flat [sky], and you. The only thing breaking the monotony is something [raised] to the west, and your [crater], a few steps away. Above you, [stars] stand in their places, too far away to recognize; looming in front of them all is the [earth], almost close enough to touch. There's no coverage from it; anyone could see you from there, a shiny speck misplaced in the [dust].
The field parts here, unexpectedly, to accommodate a small [platform]. They call it a [mesa], the geographical term, but there's nothing natural about it. The slope leading up is too carved, too precise, and the edges are cut too well against the night [sky]. It seems to repel everything; the [dust] is gathered in a [moat] around it, the craters leave a [perimeter], and even the [stars] duck away from it. It's a clear jump, from there, up to the earth. Or so the others say. Your part of the moon continues a ways to the east.
Calling this a crater would be generous. It's more of a pockmark in the ground, a blemish where rocks and sediment have settled into a thicker than usual pile of [dust]. From here, you can peer over the walls to see a sliver of the surface.
Joe's [Bar] An undistinguished [bar], yet the social center of Upper Sandusky. The front [door] is almost lost amidst the hazy maze of neon that shrouds the grimy [glass] of the south wall. [Doors] marked "Ladies" and "Gents" lead, respectively, northeast and northwest.
Though operating at far below normal speed, your mind begins to conclude that it would be best at this point to find a [bathroom].
Even if you don't care about your [clothes], imagine the embarrassment!
You can't wait another second. Without going into embarrassing detail, you've made a mess. A moment later, before even half the people in [Joe's] have begun [tittering], a flash of green [light] precedes the arrival of two VERY odd patrons. They rotate their bellies to get a better look at you. As their [mouth] stalks open you find that, despite an evolution that occurred dozens of astronomical units from Upper Sandusky, these fellows speak in perfect midwestern English. "This one?" "A pitiful specimen ... can't even control simple bodily functions ... the tests would be worthless..." "Agreed. Must've been a screw-up somewhere. Let's take this one instead." They grab a blonde [woman], whose scream is cut short by another green flash. Three weeks later, when the [Earth] is invaded and everyone is enslaved by the Leather Goddesses of Phobos, you wonder if there was a connection.
The [forest] is beautiful in the fall, and I am glad to be walking through it with you. I wish it was under better circumstances. All of the things you wanted to escape lie to the south.
The [forest] is oddly silent. Your footsteps echo as you pace back and forth. I wonder where all the birds have gone.
Everyone's gone. The [mess] from the funeral remains.
The narrow, dingy [bathroom] of Scummett block is furnished with a [bath] and a [toilet]. The [wallpaper] peels miserably, as though ? knowing from the first that it was doomed to languish in a humid cesspit ? it could never quite summon the motivation to stand upright. The [stippled glass] on this shady side of the building admits little light, but the [door] leading south into the corridor is [outlined] in faint brightness.
This is the west end of a [carpeted] corridor providing access to all of the rooms in Scummett block. Most of them are poky student bedrooms, but the two communal facilities ? bathroom and kitchen ? are located north and south of here. The corridor continues to the east. A [door] to the west leads [outside].
This is the east end of Scummett block, where the otherwise featureless creamy torso of the [ceiling] is punctuated, navel-like, by a [smoke alarm]. Back to the west, the corridor stretches past the communal rooms to the exit. Various bedrooms branch off the corridor here, most of their [doors] left casually ajar, but you recognise only three of them: Lyssa's room, to the north, Mark's room, to the northeast, and the Nerd's room to the south.
The [dusty carpet of Mark Oddleigh's] room is swathed in [discarded] [lecture notes, promo CDs], and other paraphernalia. A [bed], a [cluttered desk], and a lime-[green inflatable] [chair] emerge from the debris like the doomed cargo of some foundering ship. The way [out] is vaguely visible to the southwest.
The [mounds] of sauce-[encrusted dishes] in Scummett block's communal kitchen lend a whole new meaning to the phrase "great [unwashed]" and are probably responsible for the weird, unidentifiable smell in here. A [fridge and gas cooker] are situated against the relevant [walls]. Northwards, the corridor beckons.
This is [Lyssa Frey-Parkin's] [bedroom], which looks onto the corridor to the south. Every last inch of the [wall], including the faux-cork region intended to serve as a notice board, is plastered with [posters]: she hasn't tackled the [ceiling] yet, but it can't be far off. [Incense sticks and bras] are strewn across the floor. A [bedside] [table] stands, as one might expect, next to [Lyssa's] [bed].
Tree branches creak as the wind whips leaves against your legs. You are at the end of a tree-lined [road] which disappears into the distance to the south.
This corner doesn't seem to get cleaned often. There is a rather large [spider web] stretched between the foot of the bed and the wall. Thankfully its [inhabitant] is nowhere to be found. The rest of the room is southwest.
This is the dormitory room you share with your three closest friends. There is a [bed] to the north, a [wardrobe] to the east, a [bookshelf] to the south, a [food storage] area to the west and a [desk] in the northwest corner.
You can see [sunlight] above you. The rest of the room is southeast.
There is a mouse [hole] in the southeast corner of the room, next to the [bookshelf].
We dance in the centre of the [cave], tumbling and falling over [ourselves]. We are excited; our [light] bounces from the [ceiling and ground], making the [shadows] spin. Occasionally, we are so excited that a few of us fall [out] the [hole] to the west and are scattered. It's not like that in the [rocks], but we can afford to suffer for a little while.
She hunkers in our [cave], fouling it. She has torn the [hole] to the west to twice its size. She is strong.
Cool and dark. We like the [surface], but we still enjoy the [crust] during the hottest part of the day. The sun can be cruel sometimes, but we would miss it were we to live here.
It is warm here: a [dull red glow] surrounds us. The [rocks] drift slowly and soothe us with their gentle rhythm.
We are hollow here: we enclose a [pocket]. But the [ground] is solid as it rolls up into the [hill] to the east and towards her to the west. [Air] rolls against us from below.
From here we can see everything. It is horrible. The [ground] is ripped apart. The [flat spots] where we would bathe in the [sun] are jagged and split. The [pools] are fouled with her [poison]. All around us, from [hill] to [horizon], are signs of her presence. We should have not let her get this far. But we were scared. We had hoped she would leave on her own, but she is relentless.
We remember this place. Here, and in the countless other [pockets] beneath the [surface], we used to dance. The caves were always a little dangerous with stray [drafts] spinning in to scatter us. Here the [air] is dense: it strains against the [pocket]. It is not like the [surface air]. This [air] is [yellow].
You find yourself on the broad [landing], halfway up the [staircase]. The expanse of plain [oak panelling] is relieved only by one of The [Reverend Patrick Angram's] favourite [biblical quotations].
The main [stairs] swoop down to the hall, there are [rooms] to the east and southeast, and a corridor bends round to the northeast. The rather [shabby strip of carpet] leads west to the gallery.
The long narrow [gallery] has [railings] on one side and overlooks the [hall] below. The length of the other [wall] is hung with [portraits] in [oils] of your illustrious forebears. The stairs are to the east, while in the opposite direction the [gallery] forks northwest and southwest.
Ah, the memories. Mama didn't think the village [school] good enough for you, so instead employed a succession of private tutors. The hours you've spent here embroiled in your studies, trying to make sense of the [writing] on the [blackboard], when you'd rather be playing games in your bedroom to the south, or even playing tunes in the music [room] to the north (or, best of all, out through the southeast [door] and away! ).
The [old nursery] lies between the sewing [room] to the south, the school-[room] to the north. You once slept here, though more recently it's been used for propagating [seedlings] for the garden.
The [music room], lying between the school-[room] to the south and the [tutor's room] to the northeast, is about as far away from the Priory's living quarters as could practically be arranged.
Last used some considerable number of years ago, the [tutor's room] lies next to the guest [room] (to the east), while the music [room] is off to the southwest. Despite the years, the [room] still bears traces of its last inhabitant: a [elderly] copy of Le [Monde], and a [photograph] of a [small town] in the [Alpes-Maritimes].
A plain and simple [room], kept ready for the Priory's (fairly infrequent) visitors. Other [rooms] lie west and southeast.
This [small alcove] at the end of a long [corridor] running south contains an easterly [door] labelled "[Fire Escape]". Round to the northwest lies the guest [room].
The [dressing room] is situated outside [Papa's bedroom] to the south, with the main stairs to the northwest. On the [wall] is a 1792 [engraving], of the first [federal building] in [Philadelphia].
The Priory's main [staircase] sweeps grandly [upwards], while the spacious entrance [hall] can be seen to the southwest. A [doorway] to the northeast leads into the [small courtyard], open but completely enclosed, which lies at the heart of the Priory.
The [hall] is a lofty echoing space, always chilly despite the enormous [fireplace]. Entering through the [main door] (which lies to the west), you'd see the [main staircase] off to the northeast, the billiards [room] to the southeast, and the study to the south. Above, [pictures] can be glimpsed through the [railings] of an [open gallery].
A smallish double-aspect [room], offering a glorious [view] of the [sea] to the south while the [village of Waldron Posy], with its distinctive [church tower] (and all too audible bell), can be seen at the end of the [drive] which winds downhill away to the west. The [room] itself is [untidy] and nondescript; the only exit is north.
You need stoop only slightly to enter the [fireplace], which is large enough inside for you to stand upright. Overhead, the bible-black [chimney] soars towards a tiny [disk of daylight]. At your feet, between the enormous [iron firedogs], lie the [ashes] of a still-warm [fire].
Ladies' Room This filthy bathroom belies the existence of disinfectant. A single [toilet and sink] are the only fixtures. [More] breathable air can be found to the southwest. You can see a stool here.
A moment later, [before] even half the people in [Joe's] have begun tittering, a [flash] of green light precedes the arrival of two VERY odd creatures.
As their [mouth] stalks begin moving you find that, despite an evolution that occured dozens of astronomical units [from] Upper Sandusky, these fellows speak in perfect midwestern English.
You are too anxious. You cannot do anything except wait it [out].
The interior of the lifeboat is rather cramped with the canvas cover on it, but it was the only place you could find to stow away on board the Lily Jane. A wisp of bitterly cold wind enters through the flap of canvas you detached to crawl inside. By exiting the same way, you can climb onto the deck of the [ship].
The aft deck rumbles with the sound of the [engine] below it, and water churns out from the back of the huge [tanker], and the unceasing northern winds howl around you. To the northeast is the starboard deck, and to the northwest is the port deck. A [ladder] leads down the back of the [ship].
Clinging to the rungs of the metal ladder, you can feel the shudder of the huge [engine] through the aft hull of the Lily Jane. If you climb up you will be on the aft deck, and climbing down will take you to the base of the ladder.
Standing on the bottom rung of the [metal] ladder, you can feel the chilly spray from the churning [blades] of the [engine] below you, and your grip is slick with salty seawater. Climbing up from here will bring you further up the ladder. The [metal hull] is within inches of your fingertips.
The cement [wharf] is sun-baked above, slapped by water below. Hieroglyphs of glare inscribed on the flat surface of the harbor. Odors of salt, and rot, and sweat, and silt. The air burns like an iron.
Your in the sparsly adorned Motel 8 "Luv Shack." It cost you eighteen dollars, one more than months you've gone with out an erection. There's a bathroom to the north, and you can leave the room to the west. A single light dangles from the [ceiling] like that dangling thing in the back of your throat. There's also a [Dauphin] sized [bed].
You are on the forest [road], cleared to the sacred cave. during your childhood you spent many an afternoon climbing the small [trees] and playing with the animals. No time for that now, time is precious. The [road] continues east. The town lies west.
The [Frent trees] here blossom the rare and wonderful germish blossom that is used throughout Punkirita to cure disease. Careful pruning is done as too not destroy this great marvel and natrual resource.
Here is all that remains of the town founder, Ms. Kim Berlite (Footnote 2) who went looking for diamonds and found the cave. She aquired the gift of botany and setup this [garden] for travelers.
The woods are exceedingly tranquil here. It seems as if the birds that hover hear try not to break the silence with their music. An occasional deer can be found here, not resting, just standing, as if reflecting. One can here their own thoughts magnified by [tenfold].
You continue your walk on the forest [road], being careful to step other a [fallen tree]. The [road] continues.
You have reached the end of the road and now stand in front of the [sacred cave]. This used to be such a happy place, and though the exterior remains unchanged phyiscally, something is wrong. No birds sing here. There is something wrong with the atmosphere around it. The [cave mouth] gapes at you, almost mocking. Its challenges lie to the east.
It seems as if you have met the the [mountain] that harbors the caverns. It seems eerie here. To the south, if your memory is correct, lies the opening.
Everything here is just like it always is, except for that [door].
This is a comfortably cluttered room. Cluttered with [bookshelves], mostly. To one side is a [large desk], on which a [computer] squats regally. A lumpy [couch] is the only other furniture of note.
The only thing of note in this clearing is the [hole] in the [ground] you use as a toilet. Beautiful flowers nestle in the trees around you, which glitter with subtle magics.
You walk into the Courtyard with your [backpack] on your back. You see round stones. North you see the [Two] Story. West you see a [door] leading to the Lunch room. East you see the Parking Lot. South you see a [wooden door] leading to Barrat Land.
The [Two] Story is the oldest building at LMS, back when LMS was LHS (Langley High School). Your [outside] of the [Two] Story. West you see the Basket Ball Court. East you see the School Store.
You walk to the School Basket [Ball] Court. You see the sunny sky and basket [ball] hoops. To the left you see a fence. West you see the field.
A tight, poorly lit, aircraft [bathroom]. Ordinarily, a welcome refuge from the demanding mortal customers who need to use planes to move from one place to another, but now a safe haven from the carnivorous lobsters infesting the plane. Your uncanny, yet always useful, sense of direction tells you that the [bathroom] is to the west.
The [mirror, toilet, paper roll, and smoke detector] are unremarkable. Your uncanny (yet invariably useful) sense of direction tells you that the aft compartment of the plane is to the west.
The [walls], floor and [ceiling] of this fairly spacious but severely delapidated room are comprised of uniform red brickwork, chipped and scratched randomly through age. A little moonlight flows in through the single, [glassless window], forming a jaunty rectangle across the floor.
Everything here is just like it always is, including that [door] to the north.
. )The [mountain] air! The [mountain] streams! The [mountain] trails! The [mountain]!
This, you surmise, is the final form of the [avalanche] that got you here -- a chaotic [pile of rocks]. The [pile] is so huge that you wonder at your survival. One man against all that [rock]? He lived? Wherever the [rocks] are not, the [mountain] is, except for a small corridor of sheer stone leading south -- at least you think it's south.
This area is the exact opposite of one of those clearings that every lost traveler always finds themselves in. In fact, it borders on oppressive. The sheer [mountain] cliffs end abruptly at and are ended abrutply at by a dense [forest] of tall [evergreens]. The roar of water from the west adds to the feeling of claustrophobia and tenseness. One tree has fallen over to the northeast, creating a sort of path in that direction, and the [rock] corridor, a jarring gap in the otherwise unchanging [mountain], leads north. In all other directions the [forest] is too dense to see through, although you could possibly walk among the [trees].
The tree, fallen from the southwest, ends just short of an almost vertical [rock face], apparently granite. The [mountain] curves menacingly all around, cutting off travel in other directions.
This area seems to be filled with abrupt ends. To the east, the [mountain] ends abruptly at the forest you came from, and vice versa. The forest also ends abruptly at the cliff which you are standing on. It's about ten feet wide and ends abruptly in midair. Far above, a riverbed abruptly ends at the abrupt end of the [mountain], generating an incredibly long but relatively narrow [waterfall]. From the roar that emanates from below, you presume that this [waterfall] ends abruptly at some flat surface, creating high-intensity sound waves which end abruptly at your ears, which end abruptly at the side of your head, which ends abrutply at your shoulders, and so on and so forth.
Inside a [fence] which seems inadequate, a chaotic collection of farm [animals] mills about. Two fat [pigs] are lying happily in a mudhole in one corner of the [pen]. [Hens] seem to be everywhere; the [rooster] can't keep track of them any more than you can -- he hurries around, croaking at them haphazardly. A few [cows] stand off to one side, mooing in irritation when [bothered] by any of the other [animals]. A small [dog] with mottled, shaggy fur barks now and then. Three or four [sheep] are huddled together in a corner, baa-ing. A tall gray [horse] moves anxiously here and there, obviously disturbed by this noisy crowd. You don't blame [him] -- the garden to the east looks so nice and quiet. To the northeast is the forest, and to the west is another bunch of trees -- but they look like fruit trees.
You emerge from the noise of the corral into the blissful quiet of an exquisite [orchard]. [Trees] of countless varieties stand in neat, even rows. Oddly, however, [trees] of the same species are not adjacent to one another. The [pear trees], for example, seem to be scattered at random. Although the [orchard] does not occupy much ground, the [trees] all appear laden with [fruit] -- surely they can't ALL be in season?
The density of the forest lessens as it goes south, and the trees finally disappear here, where a ramshackle [fence] encloses a square patch of ground on which grow various [vegetables]. Tiny [cornstalks] are beginning to sprout, and there are rows of little [carrot-tops]. [Poles and wicker lattices] set into the earth indicate that beans and tomatoes are expected. The [garden] adjoins an old [log cabin], of which you seem to be facing the [backside]. A path leads south around the side of the building, and it looks as though you could enter by the [back door].
You are facing the front of the [log cabin]. In contrast to the wilderness around it, it is built perfectly square; it seems almost out of place, as though it was assembled somewhere else and then inserted into this scene. In the exact center of the front [wall] is a [door]. A massive tree stands similarly alone to the southwest. Around the side of the [cabin], a path heads north; a smaller path, heading east, branches off of it. Some way off to the south you can see a [wall], and then the land appears to end.
The [kitchen] is small but seems functional. A tall [cupboard] occupies one corner, flanked by a [refrigerator] and a gas stove. The rest of the [room] is occupied by a [fair-sized] [wooden table]. A hallway leads west, and the back door leads out.
This area is barren. The few small shrubs which do grow lean toward the mountain in terror, blown relentlessly by the wind from over the nearby cliff. In blatant exception to this is one [monumental] [tree], a [redwood]. It is almost 2 meters in diameter, and could easily be 100 meters tall. You must crane your neck painfully to look at its peak, and when you do, you see that most of its branches are as thick as your torso. Then, in another blatant denial of what was said before, the magnificence of the [tree] is overshadowed by the fact that is has been [hollowed] out. A [huge, door]-like [hole] faces north, toward the mountain, and apparently is the entrance into a veritable [room] within the [tree]. To the east you can see an awesome precipice, but jagged rocks make it impossible to reach from where you are now.
The space within the [tree] is small in floor area, but seems very large because the [ceiling] is so high; the [hollow] part of the [tree] extends upwards for four or five meters. As you soon as you turn your attention to the floor, however, reality sets in -- there is barely enough [room] for you to lie down.
Only the best is good enough for the main room of the Secret Service headquarters. The [walls] are oak-panelled, and covered with photographs of important-looking people; the floor sparkles so much that you suspect it has been enhanced with the aid of a spell; and the equipment is all top-of-the-range, including the Magic Weaver in the corner.
The [lush green grass] of this large [field] makes it perfect for keeping [sheep]. They graze all day, but the [grass] never seems to thin. Through the [thick] hedgrerows to the west lies another of your [fields] and a [track winds] north towards Bethlehem.
You don't use this [field] as much as the one to the east. Without the attention from your [herd], the [grass] has grown very long; it now extends to your [knees]. A [gnarly old tree] stands in the middle of the [field], surrounded by [mulberry bushes]. The [sweeping hedgerows] break to the southwest and southeast, and you can just make [out] your [herd] grazing to the east.
The [tree], while [old] and creaking, stands tall and proud amongst your [fields]. You haven't climbed it in years, but your [feet] follow the dry [branches] perfectly.
[Daisies] cover the [ground] of this [field], replacing the grass completely. In fact, you see nothing but [daisies], except to the northeast, southeast and east, where the [hedgerows] part. How [peculiar].
This [field] marks the [edge] of your [land], and you don't frequent it often; the [coarse grass] underfoot exemplifies the [tough nature] of the [terrain]. Before you lie three [bushes], beaten into [strange shapes] by the [prevailing] [easterly wind]: [hawthorn] on the [left, rosemary] in the [centre and juniper] on the far [right].
Everyone's [out] to enjoy the weather today. Beneath an oddly shimmering [sky, children] play on [swing sets, couples] chat at [picnic tables, and folks] in [patriotic jumpsuits] gaze up at a [giant flagpole]. A footpath leads north to a cluster of buildings.
This shed is packed with [bicycles, [boxes]], [brooms], and other "B" [items]. There are even a few [umbrellas] -- kind of a stretch, you think.
You are walking along a [dusty] [path]. It continues to the north but, for some reason, doesn't go in any other direction.
You appear to be on the same [path] as before. In the distance, the lights of a small town flicker dimly.
This [town] appears really to only consist of one building. It is to your east. The path continues north.
You are standing at a turn in the [path]. To the east, you see some kind of building. Unlike the other [paths], this one continues to the south.
This appears to the [funkey's] [farm]. [Apricots] litter the floor.
This tavern appears to have no custom other than a short [man] in a [striped jumper] sitting in the corner. This is in part due to the fact that they sell no [beer]; a [sign] on the [wall] proclaims "[Swiggles'] - The [bar] that's fit for (and run by) a [puritastard]. ".
Very warm, breathing is a malicious task. The [walls] are a dynamic gray, changing tones and moods, some casting light and others darkness. The heat rises from the floor, a rocky slab of some sort, dotted with bits of [rag] and whatever clings to them. The [ceiling] is high, unreachable, a static gray of equal parts. Featuring no sharp corners, the room bottlenecks to the east.
The [walls] splinter off into [both] northeast and southeast retreats. To the west lies the Oven.
As you enter this room, the floor seems to disappear, as do the [walls and ceiling]. In fact, it appears you are floating, though you can feel the floor. You try to focus on anything, but it's all the same and all as vast. Is there even light in this room? Your own body seems to be cloaked from your site, yet there is no definite darkness. Hopefully, you can find your way back out.
The room's loan feature is a big [door] on the eastern [wall], which is frantically, but silently, moving. Seems like something is in it.
You find yourself [chained] to a [throne of gold and alabaster], strapped onto the back of a huge [birdlike creature], covered in a ridiculously garish [plumage] of oddly nuanced [feathers] which occasionally whips around as a burst of [wind] gets too close. Yep, that's right. You're flying. Close to the limit of sound.

This is near the middle of the [ballroom], at a French [door] leading out to the [patio].
There's a broken [glass] here.
This is the northern end of the [ballroom].
Elsewhere in this large [ballroom], there are scores of other [party guests] dressed in all sorts of outlandish [costumes], such as three people dressed as mice wearing dark [glasses].

Dining [Room] This is the formal dining [room]. To the south is the long [hall], to the east the [kitchen]. A [crystal] [chandelier] dominates the [room], hanging over a large walnut [table]. On the east wall convenient to the [kitchen] is a long sideboard. On the north wall is a [china cabinet]. The west wall is mostly [windows] which overlook the [garden].

Performance [Ring] This is the [arena's] oval-shaped performance [ring] which is occupied by a sagging, rectangular safety [net].
[Platform] You're standing on a small, unstable [platform] which is suspended high above the [arena] floor by guy [wires] [converging] on it from all [directions].
You are standing, perched precariously high above the [arena] floor, a couple of baby steps across the [tightrope].

And now the day to start your new job has finally arrived. And what's worse is...your twenty minutes late. Twenty minutes late to your first day working at the Planetron Defense Laboratory. You usually aren't late for anything, but for some reason you found this place to be further than you expected. After passing through the gate with the keycard, you quickly drive into the parking lot, park the car, put the keycard back in the glove [compartment], and step out into the desert heat.
A spacious, clean, carpeted room, with a [desk] on one side and waiting [chairs] on the other. Behind the [desk], you could see a [clock], filing cabinets, and all the things you would usually find behind a front [desk]. A hallway next to the counter leads north, while the [glass doors] back south lead back to the [parking lot].
There is something about [Madam Spider's] [parlor] that is [both] banal and unsettling. The ornately patterned [wallpaper] seems to press in from every direction. [Heavy red drapes] block the only [window] in the room, adding to the sense of claustrophobia. A [black divan] sits in one corner, not far from [Madam Spider's] [rocking chair], where the [giant arachnid] is busy with her [knitting].
The [paneled music room] may once have been full of song and laughter (for some reason you do not doubt this), but now [everything] is quiet, still. Even the [air] around you [carries] a certain staleness.
The [slate-gray dining room], though [gaudily] decorated, is devoid of any sense of warmth. A long [marble-top table] takes up most of the space, the rest of which is occupied by a [Chippendale]-[style china cabinet]. The [faux flames] of the [chandelier] overhead are reflected in the [window] on the opposite side of the [table].
An [amber glass sconce] throws a warm glow over the [landing] at the [top] of the [stairs]. Straight ahead, you see a [pair of bifold closet [doors]], and to the east, a beautiful [hand-carved door of black walnut].
The [wallpaper]-lined [hallway] comes to an L here, with passages continuing to the east and south. To the west, you see a [simple wooden door].
This is where the [hallway] from the north comes to a [dead-end]. There is a [rail] overlooking the [stairway] to the east. To the west, a [long flannel curtain] marks the entrance to another room.
This [room] was once occupied by [children] -- ostensibly Madam [Spider's] [children]. If you couldn't tell from the [metal-frame bunk] bed, the [enormous cartoon spider] painted on the [wall] would've given it away. Years ago, this may have been a cheerful place, but now it is desolate. The [beds] are stripped and [clumps of dust] have collected in the [corners]. An [undressed window] offers a [view] of the equally [barren night sky].
Who knows what might be hidden in the dark rafters and shadowy corners of this [emporium]?
The [light] takes shape, the shape of so many broad [steps] your eyes swim. You can't see the edges of the [steps] to left and right where they taper into the distance, and the top and bottom of the [flight] also melt into the [shining]. The [golden stone] they're hewn from seems hard enough to be eternal, soft enough to sink into. The [air] is sumptuously cool, sweet.
You see [mortals], sad [lost] things, in their multitudes. They never stop their scurrying, killing and dying. Their acrid, gangrenous smells rise almost to your nostrils, and the [smokes and fires] of their lusts burn everywhere, clogging the universe with [ash].
The [boulevard through] the windscreen is lined with [ash trees], thick [trunks] casting shadows and gnarled [roots] mangling up the [sidewalk]. You're sat in your [car], parked too high up the [kerb]; just [outside] the [gate] to No. 15. Just an ordinary [house]. With a body inside.
A tasteful little [porch]; white painted wood strapped onto [red]-brick [building]. The front [door] is north, and [through] a small [diamond of frosted glass] you can make [out] nothing of the wood-panelled hallway inside. Your neck is sweating; sunlight hides behind the trees to the south.
The front [door] is north, and [through] it you can see the wood-panelled hallway inside.
The [boulevard] is lined with [ash trees], thick [trunks] casting shadows and gnarled [roots] mangling up the [sidewalk]. Your [car] is parked too high up the [kerb]; just [outside] the [gate] to No.
You're further along to the west, standing [outside] No. 17.
You're further along to the east, standing [outside] No. 13.
You stand in a vast glass-[ceilinged] atrium. The main [doors] stand behind you to the south, in front is the rest of the museum. The part that you actually need to clear is through the [little door] to the back rooms, behind the [information] [desk] to the east. The portrait gallery opens off to the west.
You are greeted by a sunny day on the steps of the [museum]. The grand [entrance] looms up to the north, while steps radiate [out] in all other directions. Going in such directions would, of course, be highly forbidden.
The [street] is deserted. Northeast, behind a high [garden wall], sits [Beacon House].
The peeling wallpaper and cracking plaster inspires a distinct lack of confidence. The room is [both] dank and dim, and the furniture inside the room seems crammed into a space too small to contain it. Wan, watery light filters in, scattered by the skeletal fingers of a dead tree right [outside] the room. The [door] out of your room is to the west; south is a tiny kitchenette and north is the bathroom.
The guest suite is equipped with a [skanky beige sofa] along the western [wall], and a [fireplace] covered with [weird black hand-related] paraphenalia on the eastern, above which is an empty expanse of [wall]. There are exits to the south, the north and the northwest.
Motionless, potential contained. Gently held by rising [ground] on every side except the southeast. Grid beneath you, sky above. The world is cool and blue, but the urgency is there. Anticipation of the fall.
Running from south to east, a [wall] as high as your [zenith], and many times wider than your [diameter], impossible to see around. Best, perhaps, to skirt around it to the northeast or southwest, avoiding collision.
You lie still against the [wall] that runs from east to south, savoring the double [point] of contact, [top] and side. But you can't stay here. Can't remain like this.
Back here again but it's no good, it's a trap, it goes only up on every side. The grid warps. The [ground] turns up at the ends. It hates you. And you are far from home, bleeding time, anxious.
The [ground] falls steadily away to the southeast, running along a [wall] towards a lower place. Just to the south is the sharp corner of the [wall], where it changes direction, from southeast to southwest.
Not a chair, precisely, despite its name, but a round pedestal carved into the rock peak, from which viewings may be taken. Overhead, a delicate superstructure, a lace of stone that would not survive in Earth's more vigorous gravity, but stands easily here, dividing the [sky] into quadrants for the taking of omens.
The broad [bowl] of the moon-sea, which stretches away some distance to the north. Immediately to your south is the [ladder] up to the Seat of Omens.
The storehouse is lined on [both] sides with heavy steel [shelves], the sort intended to handle the inventory of a 20th-century supermarket. (You should know, because that's where you got them from.) These [shelves] are themselves occupied with the produce of a long and successful salvage career.
The empty plane stretches away to the south, only to end abruptly in the peak on which the Seat of Omens is placed. In the center of this area stands the [Planar Gate], an unimpressive affair that looks not unlike a large open door-frame made of [butter].
You take in rather perfunctorily the objects of your daily life -- the [tripod], the [yellowed parchment] in which you sleep -- but nothing particular catches your eye.
Dark [stained oak paneling] with well-[polished brass knobs and rails] attempt to give this smoky [room] a dignity it doesn't deserve. Rich detailing aside, this is the [doorstep] to depravity, and the less time you spend here, the better. For those who think otherwise, there is a [plush red sofa] against the far wall, positioned directly under a life sized [painting] of Ulysses S. [Grant]. To the south is an [oak door] leading outside. To the north is a [glass door] leading to the [main room].
The tall [grass] extends as far as you can see, rippling slightly in the [wind].
This relatively quiet stretch of South Main [Street] houses several of the university's buildings. In front of you is the headquarters of the university's band program, affectionately known as the Band Hall. A huge [mural] runs the entire length of the flat, stucco building. To the west is the entrance to the Band Hall, and to the south, further down the sidewalk, is the post office.
This is a small area with a low [ceiling], just off the side of the band room. To the south is the office of Mr. Copenhagen, Director of Bands. To the east is the band room.
This cramped area, just southwest of the main rehearsal hall, consists of a dirty old [couch] situated in a corner. Often, one finds students stopping here to relax and chat between activities. It is adjacent to the band offices and the "Cage". There are exits to the east, northeast, and west.
The cage is an area located underneath one of the upstairs rooms. Instead of a [wall] separating it from the main rehearsal room, there is a chain link fence. The door leading into the cage isn't a door at all, but a swinging chain link gate. What the building lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in functionality. There are exits to the east, south, and west.
This area is the part of the cage where music is copied for the band. A sophisticated color [copier] sits against one [wall]. There are exits to the west and north.
There's not much inside this tiny closet except a small [table] with a [coffee maker] and a few old [programs] from past band concerts.
This area is filled with rows and rows of [file cabinets]. They are full of thousands of pieces of concert band and jazz band music.
This is [Tim Cranshaw's] office. [Tim] is in charge of all the band's equipment and [instruments]. His office is small and [cluttered] with stacks of papers, pieces of musical [instruments], and other junk lying around. [Tim's] [desk] is probably the most [cluttered], messy [desk] that you have ever seen. You wonder how he gets anything done in here.
It has been said that if you wish to experience death,just spend time in a featureless [white] room. Fortunately for you, this room features a door in the south wall to break up the monotony of its blank [white] walls. In addition, the floor isn't solid [white] but instead has a [copper-colored grid] embedded in it. The room is lit by soft, diffuse [white] light which seems to emanate uniformly from the entire [ceiling].
An [elevator]; pretty much like any other [elevator] you've ever been in. Your increased weight conveys the sensation of movement and the floor [indicator] above the closed [doors] changes as the [elevator] passes floors. Next to the [elevator doors], several dozen [buttons] are arranged in two rows.
Even with your eyes forced wide open all you can see is a dim [yellow haze] -- no pattern, no texture, no shapes. You are closely held on all sides by [something] cool but gently yielding.
This is where you live with your buddy Jim. His [stuff] adorns every surface of the room. The front [door] leads [out] to the north.
A formless place, such as you have often seen before; where dreams end and tasks begin. The floor is uneven, cupped like the palm of your master's hand. The [walls] [shimmer] with the [artifice] of your sending.
A narrow ledge of solid [rock] at the southern end of a great cavern. Beyond it lies a body of [water] so [flat], so black and tranquil, that it might be a surface of polished [obsidian].
This is your [home]. A small [cottage] that you built for you and your [daughter]. Made from the wood of the surrounding trees, it blends in very well with the surroundings. The room is not well furnished. There is just a [table], an old [stove and two beds]. In one of the [beds] lies your [daughter, Crystal]. Set in the south [wall] of the [cottage] is a small square [window].
You stand in a small clearing in the wood. Just to your south you see a [little] [cottage]. It is totally silent here, even the birds have stopped  singing. To the North is the East road.
The road bends here, taking you [either] north or east.
The [path] that you came in on stretches off to the north-east, along with the [lawn]. To the west is the start of the [big forest], and to the south is the front [porch].
The wooden overhang of the porch is handy for keeping the rain off, and in summer you could sit [out] here on the rocker (which seems to have disappeared) and drink root beer. Steps to the north lead down to the yard, and the [door] opens to the south.
The entry hall is kind of cramped, even with everyone else gone. Stairs lead up to the second floor, and the hall itself leads south from the front [door] to the dining room, and east and west to the library and kitchen.
Uncle Oscar's library is small but the [shelves] have a good selection of [mystery novels], and the [table] in the center of the room is nice to sit at and read them.
Uncle Oscar's [kitchen] is fairly simple: some [cupboards], a [fridge], an [oven], a [counter] with a [sink] built in. It didn't actually get used all that much -- he always griped about Daisy's cooking. You never saw anything wrong with it, but then again, you've always been a fan of peanut-butter sandwiches. The [back] door to the [kitchen] opens onto the forest to the west; to the east a [doorway] leads into the entry hall.
This is the western [side] of the house, a narrow [strip of grass] stretching from the [kitchen door] to the [forest]. In one place the [grass] has been replaced with a large [mosaic] made of inlaid [bricks].
The [aft] end of the aircraft. The [cabin] continues [foreward], which, based on the direction of travel, is also east.
The [fore] end of the aircraft. The [cabin] continues [aft], which, based on the direction of travel, is also west.
The oddly empty [cockpit] is completely devoid of controls. Only a solitary label reads "[Autopilot]", and a red [light] is [blinking] madly beneath it.
This is the living room of your rather squalid apartment. The huge [compass rose] on your floor reminds you that your bedroom is west, the front hall is north, the kitchen is east, and the bathroom is south.
This is the front hall; a [door] north leads outside, and the living room is to the south.
The salient feature, to borrow a technique from Detective, is the exit to the north. Sure, there's a [sink], a [tub], a [toilet], a [medicine cabinet], and so on in here, but I promise you that you lose nothing by failing to examine them.
This is your [kitchen]: [walls] papered in a yellow floral design, [counter, cabinet, sink, stove, table, chairs, fridge, microwave], and so on. The living room is west.
The [bedroom] is pretty grim these days. It's a beige rectangular prism with a [bed] in it. There are also the usual [bedroomy] things: [dressers], a [lamp], a [nightstand], and so on.
The design of virtual space can be almost [anything], but in this case the room is merely a small [cube] surrounded by an [electric fence], with [lines] of blue against black crossing the floor and [ceiling]. A large square [door] is inset into the floor, slightly off the center, sending the design of the entire room into asymmetrical confusion.
The Quentulus Quazgar Mountain Range lies to the north of this barren desert land. A single booth lingers on the horizon, but it is too far to reach easily. [Fenchurch and Ford] are by trudging along wearily beside you.
A single booth lingers on the horizon, but it is still too far to reach easily. [Fenchurch and Ford] are by trudging along wearily beside you, as always.
Wind whispers through the feathery branches of the [bamboo] forest surrounding you as warm sunlight showers down, gently filtered by the delicate [leaves] overhead. The soft [ground] is carpeted with slender browning [leaves], occasionally stirred up by the cool breeze. Faint tracks run southeast and east, one also continues to the north up a bank, and another downwards into a small depression to the south. An impenetrable [barrier of thorns] lies to the west. How they got there after you passed that way last night is anyone's guess.
The air in the cave is cold and damp. A chill wind blowing inwards from the [sea] causes your eyes to sting in the salt-laden air. The tide chews at the [jagged rocks] which protrude from the [ocean] surface several yards out. Boulders being rolled under the surface make loud rumblings like distant thunder - they sound like they could smash anything. The [water] looks uninviting - the [rocks] threaten to dash the foolish swimmer to pieces. Behind you, to the north is a passageway leading up to the surface.
As you stand with your back to the [cliff], the view ahead of you appears to be nothing but a blur fading from dark grey sea [below], through to a light powder blue [sky].
Not much can be seen from this vantage point. A thin veil of fog blocks the view [out] to [sea]. The [waters] [below] churn menacingly, the spume a milky white.
The forest opens [out] into a large clearing as the [trees] retreat from a [lake] that dominates the centre. Flies lazily buzzing in the warm air occasionally dip down to the [water], causing a ripple to break the mirror surface as a [fish] reacts in kind. Not even a breeze disturbs the surface of this image of tranquility. A smooth [boulder] protrudes from the centre of the [lake], the reflection giving the impression of a [boulder] floating in the [sky]. The [white sand] surrounding the [water] is soft and warm underfoot.
Cypress [trees] form a straight avenue several feet wide, running from west to east. The [path] continues some distance to the east, where it terminates in an [archway] - and back into the forest to the west.
West of [House] You are standing in an open field west of a white [house], with a [boarded] front [door]. You could circle the [house] to the north or south.
South of [House] You are facing the south side of a white [house]. There is no door here, and all the [windows] are [boarded].
North of [House] You are facing the north side of a white [house].
A narrow [path] winds north through the [trees].
[Forest Path] This is a [path] through a dimly lit [forest], curving from south to east. A large [tree] with low [branches] stands by the edge of the [path]. On the [ground] is a [pile of leaves].
Up a [Tree] You are ten feet above the [ground, nestled] among large [branches].
Behind [House] You are behind the white [house]. [Paths] lead into the [forest] to the east and northeast. In one corner of the [house] is a small [window] which is slightly ajar.
[Forest] This is a dimly lit [forest], with large [trees] all around.
[Forest] Edge [Paths] lead into the [forest] to the west and northwest. Also, a well-marked [path] extends east.
Canyon View You are atop the west wall of a great canyon, offering a marvelous view of the mighty Frigid [River] below. Across the canyon, the [walls] of the White [Cliffs] join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains. To the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with [rainbow]. Even further upstream, the [river] flows out of a great dark cavern. To the west is an immense forest, stretching for miles. It seems possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
Canyon Bottom The [walls] of the [river] canyon may be climbable here. To the northeast is a narrow [path].
End of [Rainbow] You are on a small, rocky beach by the Frigid [River], below the falls.
Inside the Barrow You are in an ancient barrow which opens to the southwest. A familiar brass [lantern] is lying on the [ground].
Great Cavern This is a huge limestone cavern, glowing with dim, phosphorescent light from far above. Narrow [paths] wind south and northeast.
An old, robed [man] appears suddenly. He is wearing a pointed hat with astrological signs, and has a long, unkempt beard.
Shallow Ford You are ankle deep in a [stream]. To the southwest is a dark [tunnel], and to the north a dim cavern.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a [grue].
The [messy] room of a man who is [both] a distracted scientist and a total slob, you're not sure you could ever find anything in the [mess] on the floor. The corridor is back to the north.
Another featureless stretch of corridor, leading from the residencial areas to the west to the [control] center to the east. The music labs are through the north [door] and the veterinary labs are to the south.
The museum, which so far appears to be a very long corridor with the occasional flight of steps, now broadens out into a slightly wider corridor. It is mostly featureless, except for the column-like [tube]. The corridor continues west and east.
Floodlights mark the border of the [stage] front, a [backdrop] painted like a [Japanese] hanging marks the [back]. Thick red [velvet curtain] droops over the [wings], which lie a mile away on either side. There is nothing but you and your [table], and the [audience] audible solely as breath held in another world.
The attic is a musty room. There are corners filled with cobwebs and just a small window of light. There are piles of books filled with notes written in Grandpa's scratchy handwriting. You pick up a leather-bound journal that you remember Grandpa always carried with [him]. The journal is filled with notes mostly covered with strange equations that you don't understand. But full pages are dedicated to transportation theories, time travel and a hidden door.
When you step [out], you are shocked. This is surely the same attic, except much different. It is somewhat newer. There aren't cobwebs in every corner and instead of the many boxes of junk there are shelves around the walls filled with clear jars. Suddenly you recognize a young man, that looks strangely familair.
This time a haze of smoke hits you when you walk [out] the door. There are vibrant colored blankets hanging from the walls and layed across the floor. There are people playing guitars and chillin [out] without a care in the world. Suddenly dressed in a flowery tunic with a peace sign swinging from his neck, you spot your [Grandpa] as his [present] self, rocking [out] like he did in the past.
Guests of every kind gather to watch the awards; [Eileen] is on [stage].
covers [ceiling, wall], and floor and front entrance east.
The rich decor covers [ceiling, wall], and floor and front entrance east.
gather to watch the awards; [Eileen] is on [stage].
Tall [grasses] line the [path] that forks off to the north and east. The [road] back home is to the west.
You find yourself standing in front of an [unruly thicket of damask roses]. Their scent permeates the air.
Giant, [cup-shaped] [flowers] sit atop tall, [dark green stalks] that stretch to about [five] times your height. Most of the [flowers] are a [deep pink], aside from one striking [orange tulip] that sits apart from the rest. A [black swallowtail] is circling back and forth around it, occasionally dipping in for a sip of [nectar].
Here the [path] culminates at a [stout lilac bush] bursting with its [distinctive] [amethyst flowers]. A [beautiful nymph] sits [sobbing] on one of its lower [branches].
You are at the base of the largest [dandelion] you've ever seen. Tall, [lance-like] [leaves] surround its [massive stem], which rises up to support a [snowy globe of seeds]. Beyond the [dandelion], to the east, the [ground] grows [marshier] and thick with [palm sedge].
Here the dirt [path] that you've grown accustomed to is replaced by a [cobblestone] [walk]. To the east, a [steep, rocky slope] leads down to the moss-[green water]. A [thick layer of mist] has settled over the [pond] making it difficult to see to the opposite side.
You appear to have come to a [dead end]. The [cobblestone] [walk] runs right up to the side of a [giant pipe]. The [steep slope] leading down to the [water] continues to the east.
The usual [quarters]: [bulkheads], sleeping [rack, desk] holding your [sidearm] and your [Tactical Display Unit]. The [hatch] to the [passageway] is to the port side.
The [Primary Transport Room] is forward from here and your [quarters] are to starboard.
The main focus of the [room] is the [transport pad], which covers most of the floor. A few [monitors and diagnostic] [equipment] surround the [pad], but otherwise the [room] is empty.
You are in the [dormitory] in your theological [seminary]. The [moon] shines in through a [window] overlooking the [seminary's] [garden] and the [Neckar] river beyond. To the east is the [dormitory door].
Though it isn't in any technical sense "your" office, this is the room where you spend the majority of your duty shifts. Here, you do background research, [monitor] incoming messages from Divers in the field, and hope that one of your [mission] proposals will be accepted. On the rare occasions, like now, that you are cleared for a dive, this room serves as a place to equip and make last-minute preparations.
The room is entirely black, save only for the glowing [stars] painted on the floor.
Sand stretches in all directions. Except to the west. That way lies... the [sea].
You are at Piazza Roma, a small square in an interesting town in the Northen part of Italy, next to Milan. At the center there is a [fountain]. A middle age building is east of Piazza Roma.
Arengario is a building made of red bricks. Under the main part there is a portico. You are inside the portico. There is a [wooden door] at north. Perhaps it leads to the main building.
You are in the main living area of your [home]. In addition to your [bed and clothes chest], it contains the dining [table], four [chairs], and the kitchen [stove]. From here you can step [out] onto the front [porch] to the east. Your [mother's] grief bleeds in from the north, the [door] to her [bedroom] doing little to conceal her sobs.
A few [steps] above the [grassy field], your front [porch] looks [out] over a wide, rolling expanse of [green]. From here, you can go back inside or step south onto the well-known [path] to grandmother's [house].
This is where you've spent nearly half of this trip. You know every detail of the [room], from the [nicks and scratches] on the [tabletop] to the [nicks and scratches] on the [tabletop]. There are two [chairs] by the table: a [large] one for you and a [smaller] one for Brutus. In the weeks you've spent here, you've deigned to call the direction leading into your quarters east and the direction leading to Brutus' west. By deduction, you determine that the [airlock] is north, and the galley is south.
This is where you've spent about a third of this trip, mostly sleeping. Your [bed] is pushed up against the [wall] to make more room for you to do those forty early morning sit-ups you keep promising yourself you'll start doing tomorrow. Your [waste disposal unit] sits smugly in the corner, grinning like the cat that ate the seven of clubs. You can also return to the rec room to the west.
This is where you've spent somewhat less than a sixth of the trip. You don't really need to spend much time here; the modern [kitchen] has been [reduced] to one [simple appliance].
The salient features of Brutus' [quarters] include a [large wheel] for [running] in, a small [bed] for sleeping in, and a [waste disposal unit] for other purposes. The sixteen-week old stench of [hamster] assaults your nostrils; blessed escape can be found to the east.
This is the world - uh, [moon]-famous [Moon Bar], recently become the hottest spot on Luna since Alvin the Chipmunk started singing here. Tonight is as busy as any other night, but the [crowd of adoring females swarming] the [stage] as Alvin returns briefly to his dressing room is just going to mean more cleaning up for you later, you can't help thinking. A little [door] behind the [bar] leads east.
Earthlight sheds a dim glow across the tall spire and broad basin of an empty [fountain]. The [fountain] is ringed with recessed lamps, but the lamps are currently off. The tall shadows of buildings block [out] the [stars] in all directions except west and south.
This is the [entrance] to the mysterious city where you arrived in response to the distress call. There is no [pressure] dome, leaving the dusty streets exposed to near-vacuum, but the [buildings] have the tall, rectangular shapes familiar to you from the Tokyo skyline. Only the blue marble of the Earth high above sheds any light on your surroundings.
So there's this [forest] that's [out] of the way but not too far [out] of the way and some folks decided to dump their old household appliances. It's tradition, now. Toaster [Hill] is entirely literal; it overlooks a winding road to the south with what has to be 20 or 30 old [toasters]. The [flashlight's] reflection gives the [toasters] a dull, gentle glare.
Ok, mostly [microwaves]. The [flashlight and starlight] together make them look like monoliths. You can keep going south if you like.
This is absurd and sad and weird and you've always wondered about this [place], because there's an old [dishwasher] that must have been there for ages, before the dumping began, because there's [plants and roots] and weird [vines and tubers] and stuff growing through it, and it's become part of the [forest]. The "normal" [trees] all keep a distance like they're afraid. Your illumination, impressively, manages to fill the entire [clearing]. You can still go further south.
Yeah people are just sick because this is the part way off the road yet there's at least 10 [fridges] arranged like they were Legos or something. Even granting some of them are only half a [refrigerator] that's a lot of effort to dump this far in. Maybe someone's made a ritual [out] of this? There's still more to the south.
You are standing next to a [statue] of a very attractive nude woman wearing strategically-placed [figleaves]. You can see a path to the east.
You are in the [motel] lobby. The floor is made of marble tiles in a checkerboard pattern. Along the wall is the front [desk]. The [motel manager], a very sedated looking gentleman, stands behind the front [desk].
The motel's gift shoppe contains a variety of knick-knacks and souvenirs. For some reason, all the merchandise is locked within Plexiglas [displays].
Room 108 is less of a room for guests, and more of a tiny, intimate venue with a puppet [theater]. There are no chairs in the room, so you assume the audience must sit upon the floor.
Among the cars parked in the lot is your  [van]. The pavement is warm under the bright sun above.
You are standing amidst the [snow covered trees of Burly Forest], looking [upward] to the [mountain] you're delaying climbing.
Rocky [holds] push their way out of this [incline] here and there, making it a little less of an [incline] and a little more of a climb. The [foot] of the [mountain] is a fair way down from here. Up above you, you can see a nice (much more [comfortable]) [plateau] you'd rather be standing on.
Sort of an intersection of treacherous climbs, this [plateau] disappears into a more [rubble-like] [path] around [both] the east and west sides of the mountain. A brief sigh of lack of accomplishment falls upon you as you look up to see how much of the mountain you've yet to climb. You know, you could always go back down.
Many [winter snowfalls] have taken their toll on this [traverse]. Hard, easily grippable rock has given away to a mostly smooth icy surface. Stray from the path here, and you'll most likely fall to your icy death. You shudder as you imagine sliding helplessly [downward].
Snug and dry, there's really no place like home. This vaulting cavern offers plenty of room for unfurled [wings] and the sandy floor, good purchase for extended talons. Bright daylight streams in through a large circular hole to the west. East, a smaller, darker opening plunges deeper into the mountain.
The cave narrows here into a corridor with dark holes branching off to the north and south. A larger, lighter one leads [back] west.
The diffuse light is a bit [dim] here, but that's okay since you usually only use your room for sleeping anyway. Sigh. Lacking your own hoard of gold to gloat over, you really don't need it for much else.
Here you spend your sleeping hours. Margaret was, just like for the rest of the house, responsible for decorating and arranging the [room] when you moved in. Without a doubt, she did this with her very own eye for detail. Once or twice, she hinted that you have been insufficiently appreciative of this. Maybe, but you do recognize the things of real practical value, like the [calendar] on the wall, at least!
This is the [house's] central hub. All other rooms, i.e. the bedroom, the kitchen, the bathroom and the currently unused room, can be reached from here. Aside from that, the front [door], located next to a large [panorama window], leads right into this room. Because of the number of [exits], there isn't actually all this much usable space available, but Margaret has come up with a clever arrangement of the [sofa] and the matching [table] as well as the slender floor [lamp] which really gets the maximum [out] of it!
The [bathroom's] walls are brightly [tiled]. Even though you can't tell for sure, you would bet that Margaret cleans it daily. Appropriate to your house's year of construction, the [facilities] are modern. For example, you had a [shower] built in instead of a tub. Next to that, there is a [sink] with a [mirror] hung to the wall above, and on the opposite side of the room, there is a [toilet]. A small [cabinet] stands on the side wall. The only exit leads into the living room.
This is [Margaret's] realm. For you, it's more a passage between the living room and the [garden]. In front of you, the familiar sight unfolds of [Margaret] standing with her [back] to you, slightly bent over the [countertop] and hard at [work] with her [kitchen utensils]. On the level of her head, a row of [cabinets] hangs on the wall and on another wall, there is a [refrigerator].
This room, which can be reached from the [living] room, is currently [unused]. You have some hopeful plans for it, of course, but they haven't worked [out] yet. Until then, Margaret has decided not to use the room for anything at all to avoid any discussion later. You haven't even painted the [walls], to be flexible as far as the coloring is concerned as soon as its new inhabitant will move in. There is a [connecting] [door] in the direction of your [bedroom].
The [steps] to the imposing front of the [museum] lead up to the north, shimmering orange in the reflection of the streetlamp's [light]. The [facade] is dull and flat like a concrete tower block but for this [portico], which has a couple of [sculptures]. Here by your feet, for example, are a couple of [stone crocuses]. Further up are some [gargoyles] on [pillars].
The marble walls and floor have fallen into shadow from the [overhang], low over your head and near enough to touch. It is supported by two wide [pillars], one either side - [carved] with a [dragon] and a [unicorn]. Quaint. To the north are the [glass] double [doors] of the place; there's a [keypad] in the wall by them. [Bushes] grow right up to you to the east.
Suddenly you are hemmed in, by [bushes] on the west side, the [museum building] to the north, and a tall [wall] to the south. Your [torch light] flicks around the space, dragging a lit circle with makes your eyes sting; flecking on the unkempt grass under your feet.
This a corner of the [gardens], by a corner of the [museum]. Tangled [bushes] grow in a heap in the pinch of the [wall], starting [right] at the bed of the [frozen river] to your west. The [gardens] continue - cold, dark, and who knows how big - up rising [ground] to the northeast. A more comforting sight is the [door] to the north, which leads inside.
The grass turns into a path of small pebbles here, as it runs uphill in a tight tunnel between the [museum] to your west and the perimeter [wall]. The path branches, and twists in a figure-eight around two [sculptures]. The first is a [stone plinth] - a [sundial] - looking more like a treestump in the dark. The second took a while to notice. It's a [mosaic], across the grass.
And here is the far end of the [garden], at the top of a hill which has buried one floor of the [museum] beneath it. This spot is a [cafe], though it can't get much custom. The [furniture] is spartan - just one [table] - and shabby, mouldy from being out in the rain. The [wall] to the east dimples to hold a group of two [trees], and then continues north until it curves to meet the [wall] of the [museum].
The small [kitchen] of the cafe is barren, understocked, and totally in keeping with the age of the furniture back east. There is a single [worktop], and beneath this is a broken [oven]. To the south is a pantry.
This is just a patch of long grass between the [trunks] of two large [beech trees], with the rest of the gardens back west, and the [wall] looping around on all the other sides.
Your [dining room] is done up in [paisley wallpaper] of which you've never been very fond, but it was there when you moved in and you never got around to replacing it. A cheap [light fixture] dangles from the ceiling, though currently the [room] is lit by [sunlight] streaming through the [window]. The kitchen lies west of here; the rest of the house is to the south.
You are in a small room with a sectional [sofa], a [computer], and some musical [equipment] . A door lies to the north.
The front yard is fairly small with empty flowerbeds around the edge of the yard. A [mailbox] is by the street, and there is a sidewalk leading north to the driveway.
You are standing in front of a silver [Ford Taurus] and a white [Ford Explorer]. A garage [door] is to the north, and a sidewalk leads south.
You are standing in the back yard. The yard is lined with a wooden fence on all sides. There is a pitbull  staring at you and panting in a non-threatening way. There is a [toolbox] by the door and a trampoline in the yard. A door lies to the west.
The [vast windows] of the [gondola] offer a commanding [view] of the [ruddy sun] as it sets into the [darkening sea]. The only landmark in sight is the great [Gothic tower] the [airship] is tethered to: an incredible stack of [columns, arches and buttresses] stretching far down into the [roiling waves].
Grey and [turbulent], the [clouds] above and [ocean] below stretch off towards the [blood-red] [setting sun]. We are atop a simple circle of [mildewed stone], seemingly suspended in mid-[air] without guardrail or balustrade. A [low dome] stands at the circle's centre.
The [wind] screams across this [narrow ledge]. The [snow] you waded through before has been scoured from this [rock]. The icy [gusts] cut straight through the [clothing] you wear, you gasp for breath in the frozen [air]. Turning your head away from the biting [wind], you strain to see in the stark white and black landscape around you, and your heart begins to beat faster. A [glint], not far above this [ledge], of something that is neither [ice] or [rock]. You should never have doubted, the tales were true!
A dream kitchen. Well, my parents' dream kitchen. Lupe, our housekeeper, is the only one who spends time in here, and she doesn't care. Mom would probably want me to draw attention to the maple [cabinets and drawers], and the [granite counters]. She's wouldn't want me to mention the old, battered [appliances]. The [fridge] is humming in the corner. [Stove] in the other corner. The living room, currently being renovated, is to the east. The foyer, to the west.
I wake peacefully, and already she is there. My angel - she is all around me. Her presence is like ice on water. But she is less than peaceful. My thoughts are all of raging storm clouds. Hurriedly, I drag [myself]
I shake my head of sleep, look around the place for one last time. The thick wet [straw] lining the loft which as been my bed for so [long]. The [rickety] old [ladder] down to [ground] level, at the [foot] of which mill a few [cows], warbling quietly, by the [gate]. Then I shake [myself]; there's no time for nostalgia, for good-byes. There is time only to grab my [bag], go, and find her.
Big. That's really the only word that comes to mind at the sight of the huge [tower of steel] before you (Footnote 1). From the look of it, it appears to be about 806 feet tall, give or take. The sight of this much [steel], arranged in this high, vertical confirmation makes you, well... It makes you wonder why you came to Paris anyway. And, for that matter, where you got the money, since you're a penniless drifter (Footnote 2). [Stairs]  (Footnote 3) lead up, far into the sky. (Footnote 4)
You're standing on the freaking huge [stairway] running up the [eiffel tower]. You can proceed in either of the more basic vertical directions.
It's like stately Wayne manor, in that it's on top of a hill, and it's very expansive and full of [expensive things], but there's no labyrinthine cave system underneath it. There's even a [big grandfather] [clock] in here, that symbolizes punctuality, but it doesn't tell the time. Because it's a dream!
So, from up here in front of the stately manor, you can see all the rest of the island. To your right, which is west of you if you're facing south, is a thick [jungle], with leaves that are deep greens and purples in their colors. It symbolizes the terror and the wonderment of the unknown. But it is impenetrable to you from where you're standing.
The [gulf] that this enchanted [beach] envelops is itself enchanted, or ensorcelled, with a [magical glamour] which makes everyone who sees it want to just sit around and take a break for once in their lives. It symbolizes taking a break for once in your life. Only you are able to resist this [enchantment], because you alone are so incredibly uptight about getting stuff done all the time and being on time for things.
When you are inside the [ship], you realize that it [symbolizes] loneliness. Specifically, loneliness brought on by being an artist, which all artists suffer from deep inside their souls.
I keep forgetting what this [jungle] is supposed to symbolize. I think it was ignorance. The [branches], heavy with [purple leaves], lean down toward you in a vaguely threatening way. It's a scary experience, but it's also kind of exciting. That's the fun of being in a coma-induced dream world.
This is an open area in the [jungle, symbolizing] the eye of the storm. It isn't the center of the [jungle], but it's the center of your experience at this point in time. It's like the guy says: Wherever you go, there you are.
About [two] dozen [people] in [various costumes] mill around. [Balloons and streamers] abound. You stand near the [refreshment] [table], trying not to look bored, or like the crasher you are.
This is a very sad way. Sad, sad indeed. Sad because of what happened with Deb? Or because of the sadness of existence? Either way, the way continues to the west and to the north. And never did that [poem] you're holding in your hand seem more relevant.
It's a long, lonely stretch of [black] asphalt and yellow painted [lines], not to mention [vehicles] of all makes and models. "Neon Nirvana" is lit up like a busy supermarket at night. The [parking lot] is bright, quiet and empty. A short [path] leads from the [lot] to the sidewalk [outside] the club.
As the wind blows, it shuffles around assorted bits of [litter, leaves, and rubbish] that congest the [sidewalk]. A bit of [graffiti] is spray painted on the [sidewalk]. You can almost feel evil lurking in the dark cracks of the pavement. This is a high-crime area, and you're cold and lonely. You long to leave, either by approaching the [nightclub] to the north, continuing east and west on the [sidewalk], or using a small concrete path leading southeast.
A tiny [alley] separates the nightclub from the next building over, which is some sort of hardware store. The street and sidewalk bend south before they pass the [alley] entrance, so the [alley] is very quiet and secluded, but oddly well-lit for such a lonely place. The walls of the [club] and hardware store make up the west and east walls of the [alley], and the building behind [both] makes up the north wall, which is uninteresting except for a small metal [door] set into it. The [alley] can be left to the west.
The [sidewalk] continues here to the east and west. This particular section passes by a small [pavilion], holding tables and chairs for those who wish to have their drink [outside] in the night air. Due to the chill, it seems that nobody's been out here tonight. Well, one or [two], maybe, but they're long gone now. A wrought iron [balustrade] separates the [pavilion] from the common [sidewalk]. A small [gate] in the [balustrade], unlocked and open, allows you to enter the [pavilion] to the north.
Stone [walls], wreathed in shadows and [velvet curtains], rise into the gloom overhead. The [old oak] writing [desk] -- once your father's, now your own -- is wedged beneath the [window lattice], with a [velvet couch] before it. A low [fire] smoulders in its ancient [hearth]. To the southeast, a [bust of Pallas] sits atop an [arch] with [darkness] beyond.
You live in a nice soft place inside a bigger space that has three ows, and one moveable ow. You call these things ows because they hurt when you run into them, and the moveable ow (mow) only He can move. The soft place is where you sleep and it smells like you. [Outside] is where He puts the food and water. The food is ok, but the milk you used to have was much better. You wonder if He could get some of that again. He always shuts the mow, but today He has left it open.
Your Place surrounds the soft place. It's much bigger and it is soft on your feet, but not as soft as the soft place. You can run around here but the three [ows] stop you. Nothing has changed from this morning when He [left] -- the [food dish], the [water bowl], the [sandbox], and the [ledge] are in their same places and they smell the same. The most interesting thing, though, is the [mow]. It's wide open in front of you.
This is a strange place. It's long, like maybe if your place were stretched [out] to your right and to your left taller than He is. The scents that invaded your place came from here, or at least some of them did. The [ows] are dabbed with white that doesn't go with the rest of the ow and they smell new somehow. The floor is soft like it is in your place but it smells wild -- full of scents that draw you to investigate them. Faintly, you also detect a sweet yet salty wild smell that can only be Goodcat/Badcat.
This wide chamber is best known for its long paneless window, providing the best view of the northern holdings of Restia. Beyond that, furnishings are sparse; other than the [bedroll] you deposited here, the only permanent fixtures the [curtains] adorning the one exit to the south.
Much of the top floor of the Imperial Palace is given over to this central hall. Designed in the shape of a cross with the center holding an [elaborate fountain], a number of open skylights would normally provide natural illumination and circulation, but tonight it is largely an atmosphere of smothered shadows.
You can see some [small beds] (on which are some [children]), some [stockings] (empty), your [bed, Mamma's] [bed] (on which is [Mamma]), and a [window] here.
You can see [Santa], some [small beds] (on which are some [children]), some [stockings] (empty), your [bed, Mamma's] [bed] (on which is [Mamma]), and a [window] here.
You can see an [abyss] and a [monster] here.
This north-south [passage] is dimly lit. The hardwood floor creaks wearily with age. Backed against the west [wall] is a small [coffee table]. Your great uncle's old [bedroom] lies to the north, and the south [archway] leads to the [lounge].
This [lounge] is incredibly plain. The only homey touch is a [plush chair]. An [archway] leads north, to the [hallway]. To the south is the [trophy room door], still jammed shut.
You are standing in your great uncle's [bedroom]. There is an [antique bed] on one side of the room, and a lot of [antique furniture] on the other. The [door] to the south is closed. [Light] shines through a [window] to the north.
A craggy, windswept patch of [dirt] atop the smallest in a vast [range of mountains]. A barely visible [path] leads down the [mountain].
Cozy, if a bit cramped. Two [beds] are stationed at opposite ends of this small room. A [window] to the west reveals the countryside.
The lounge car is a fine place to sit and relax. [Windows] to the east and west let in the pale light of the countryside as it rushes by.
This aisle contains a [door] to the east to the maintenance [room] of the train. [Windows] to the east and west show the countryside.
The dining car contains [tables] with surrounding [seats]. No food is being served at present.
You're standing in front of the large [building] which supposedly contains the idol. Directly to the north, there is a big [gate]-like [entrance portal] leading inside. The [building] stretches quite far to one side so that its left side is hardly visible to the northwest. To the northeast, the right side of the [building] (which is comparatively small) can be seen. You arrived here from the south, so this is a likely escape route.
This wing of the [building] is relatively small. You can see a [door] in the [wall] directly west of you. To the southwest, there is the large [entrance] gate and to the northwest, you can reach the back of the [building].
There are quite a few [windows] embedded into the [wall] here. The left side of the [building] is to the southwest, the right side to the southeast.
You sneak along the largest wing of the [building], pressing [yourself] to the [wall] in order to avoid detection. To the southeast, you can see the main entrance and to the northeast, you can go to the back of the [building].
The living room is tastefully decorated. The furniture is [arranged] to make maximum use of the limited space. A [bookshelf] takes up one [wall], while a [sofa and end table] are pushed up against another. Directly across from the [sofa] is a [television].
This is a small kitchen. The only things of note here are the [refrigerator] and the [stove]. The only exit is to the west, towards the living room.
This appears to be a combination [bedroom]/[computer] room. A [futon] occupies one corner, while a [desk], which has a [computer] on it, occupies another. The living room is to the north, the bathroom is to the east and a walk-in closet is south.
This is the [bathroom], which has the usual (if somewhat dated) fixtures: [bathtub, toilet, sink and medicine cabinet].
This is a walk-in closet. You don't find anything unusual here: [clothes, shoes, boxes] and other [assorted junk]. Like [everything] else in the house, though, it is [neatly arranged]. The only exit is north.
Getting to sleep in the master [bedroom] is only one of the many advantages you enjoy as a new home owner. This [bedroom] is actually smaller than the one you lived in a year ago and a thousand miles away, but as much as you love your old roommates, you have no desire to go back to living in a renovated garage. Your [bed] sits between two [dressers], against the east [wall], and the master [bathroom] is to the west.
There's not nearly enough [counter] space in your [bathroom], so every available surface except for the [toilet] seat is covered with [vitamin bottles, toothbrushes], nail [clippers], or some other [implement] of personal hygiene. Your [bedroom] is to the east.
There's nothing to look at here. Well, there may be, but without [light] the issue is rather moot.
Fake [dawnlight] streams through drawn [blinds]. The [erogater] is at her [desk], thumbing through [papers]. Behind her, [some] kind of [critter] languidly swims through a murky [aquarium]. The only exits are a [stainless steel door] on the east [wall] and the hallway [door] south.
Flourescent [lights] saturate the hallway emerald. The sole decoration is a huge [morale poster] covering the [wall]. The [ministry] branches off west into a maze of corridors, the [erogater's] office is at the north end of the hall, and if you keep going south you'll hit the exit.
Utilitarian metal [room, shelves] full of incoming and outgoing [gear]. A [sign] is bolted to the [wall] above the sink. This is the main filter between Chalice City and the [ministry]. Go east and you hit the exit gate. North leads back into the [ministry].
Bars of [purple flourescence] buzz in the ceiling.
A dark metal [room] lit only by a [plexiglass] [window]. A sliding iron [gate] fills the east [wall]. This is the last layer before leaving the [ministry].
The phone is back in its cradle, and you're alone with your [pillow] and covers. You're really too tired to do much of anything but sleep.
You're on a beach. It's very [sandy] where you're standing. To the north it becomes more [watery], primarily thanks to the [ocean]. Above the [ocean] is a stirring [sunset], the kind that would put young couples in the mood for porking of the romantic variety. Unfortunately for you, you're on your own. High [cliffs] climb above you to the east and south, and a path winds through small [sand dunes] to the west.
You're now on Kelly Street. On the left side of the street are four high [palm trees], gently swaying in the breeze. Below them is a large [bush]. On the right side of the street is a picnic area with a [table, bench] and a [barbeque], islands in an ocean of [grass]. The road continues to the west and returns east to the beach. To the north and south are carnivorous [dinosaurs]. They eye you with razor-toothed interest.
The center of this small village is a roughly circular [clearing] in the jungle-[forest] that covers most of this island. A [gigantic tree] stands in the middle, reaching hundreds of feet up into the cool night air. The [huts] of the villagers are strewn around the [clearing's] border, close to the jungle. A [large stone circle] contains [charred] wood from last night's [bonfire], and there is a [rickety wooden platform] under one of the lower [branches] of the [tree].
The cottage's interior is rather nice, actually. A heavy marble table sits among ruby [tiles], gold trimming lines ornate [pillars], and the [sapphire] studded [ceiling] is garnished with a crystal [chandelier].
This grey area is filled with [stone sculptures] of all types of [creatures]. Upon closer examination you note they are extraordinarily well carved. A strange feeling you usually don't get in museums comes over you.
You are at the base of a small [hill] in the land of Mount [Moriah]. The [path] upward towards the place of worship leads north.
The path gradually winds upwards towards the hill [top] to the north. South is the foot of the [mountain] from which you came.
The path levels [out] to a [plateau]. The trail continues to the north. Back to the south is the path leading down the hillside.
The trail ends at a [mound of dirt] piled two [cubits] in height. This [mound] serves as an [earthen altar]. Behind the [altar] the [bush] grows thick.
At one time, your apartment could have been featured on the cover of an IKEA catalogue, but your newly acquired pet has turned the decor into a disaster. Your [bed, bookcase, and coffee table] are nearly destroyed, and a [pile] of mangled [CDs] lies near the mostly unscathed [stereo]. Against one [wall] is a small black refrigerator, and near it is the [computer] that holds your [thesis]. A [sliding glass door leads] south to your balcony and your front [door] lies to the north.
You are atop the Eiffel [Tower]. A small [counter] can be seen with an [orange juice dispenser]. A door leads east to the outer rail. The bathroom door is boarded up and a sign reads 'Hold it.'
You feel on top of the world. Below you, and all around, are the ruins of [Ancient Paris]. The archaeological dig is doing marvelous work, and soon you should be able to see pretty much what the [city] must have looked like several hundred years ago. [Suspension] [bridges] stream out from here to the various hovercraft that comprise the archaeological settlement: Your quarters are to the east, and to the north are the main offices. You can also go down to the main part of the dig.
It's taken a lot of digging and laser-blasting to get this far. The [dust] is flying everywhere; a small room to the north has been uncovered recently, and while it would provide some shelter, you are unsure as to what its original function might be. You could, of course, climb back up to the top of the tower, above the flying [dust].
The room is small, unlike what you have come to expect from previously uncovered rooms. A kind of [bench], about waist-high, is against one [wall]; above it is a [rectangle covered] over with a [dustcloth].
Various [holo images] show interpretations of what Ancient Paris must have looked like; all of them include the Eiffel Tower at the centre of [everything]. There are various pieces of [equipment], ranging from high-tech to antiquated, lying around. Meanwhile, suspension bridges lead south to the tower itself and southeast to your own quarters.
You're on top of a tall [tower] in Paris. You don't remember its name. Something is obviously very wrong.
The field stretches all around you endlessly, or at least for a few feet, which is the extent of your vision. Being as close to the [ground] as you are makes it difficult to see very far. The [sky] reaches [out] in all directions below you, the soft [ground and grass] above you, which is an unfamiliar feeling for you, but then, you've never been stuck on your back like this before.
The light of the Marquis [Theatre] spills [out] to dazzle the [sidewalk]. [Playbills] adorn the exterior wall, some faded but one in particular bright and [new]. A well dressed [throng] has gathered for the opening, and chatter fills the air.
The street opens here into a small [square]. A few [trees] push up through the [concrete], and there is a wooden [bench] for pedestrians to rest. [Streets] lead off the [square] in [many] directions, notably east where the Marquis Theatre stands.
A dead end alley leads along the side of the Marquis [Theatre], the front of which lies to the southeast. The [fire escape] of the opposite [building] casts a jagged shadow over the [theatre wall] and its solitary [window]. The noise from [theatre] and city is quieter here.
Your "[station]" is a [solid metal enclosure] just barely large enough to accommodate your [chair and yourself]. On the [wall] in front of you are the [many] brightly-colored [controls] of the [security] [console] and a [black]-and-white [monitor].
I am at the [bottom] of a very deep [hole], ankle deep in [mud and sludge]. I can see the [top] of the [hole] several hundred feet [above] me, which appears to be the only [exit].
This is the [central hub] of Station One, with passages radiating out in [four] directions. The administrative offices are to the north, the space dock is west, the recreation facilities are east, and the crew quarters are south. A [ladder] leads up to [Central] Control.
All of the station personnel live in these [crew quarters]. While [officers] get private [rooms], the [cadets] are required to share the [barracks]. My room is south of here, and the central hub is north.
Several [tables and benches] are lined up here, so the station personnel have a place to sit while eating their meals. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all served here, but all [three tend] to taste the same. The Low-G Gym is to the east, and the central hub is west.
This room is completely empty except for the [kiosk] built into the west wall. A [sign above] the [kiosk] reads "Equipment [Requisitions]".
This is a [hallway] filled with offices. The requisitions office is west, the General's office is north, and Colonel Calvert's office is east. The central hub of the station is to the south.
I wouldn't expect to find a cave on a space station, but that is the closest analogy to [Calvert's] [office]. Every piece of [furniture] is buried beneath [piles of files and papers]. Somewhere in the middle of all of this is [Colonel Calvert's] [desk].
The [giant airlock doors] that make up the west side of the [space dock] are used to ease [shuttle craft] out into the cold vacuum of [space]. A [towering crane arm] stands at the ready for the next launch or landing. The [passageway] back to the central hub is east.
This large room is used by the station personnel to keep in shape while spending time in space. The [gravity] is intentionally kept lower here for playing some sports, such as [low-g] target ball. This room is also used by the General to hold station-wide meetings. It looks like no one is using the [gym], currently.
Standing in the middle of [Central Control] is like standing at the heart of the world. From this room, [SciCorps staff] are [controlling] all aspects of Station One, as well as keeping continual watch on the operations on the [planet below]. Thousands of [monitors] display [images] broadcast from locations as distant as the other side of the [planet].
The grey walls are covered with some obscene flashy [paintings]. The only opening is a small [window] with [bars]
A small room in an older motel. It is clean and comfortable, sparingly furnished, decorated all in neutral colors. There is a queen-size [bed], a [dresser], a [night stand], and a full length [mirror].
A big, open room with a [coffee bar] near the entrance. According to the [menu] on the wall, they serve [expresso, cappuccino], [latte, and drip]; hot or cold.
The road north [out] of downtown Ottumwa. It is a blacktop [four]-lane road with a low, narrow median in the middle. Much of the road is lined on either side with large older trees, and the surrounding area is mostly residential. There is an angle street to the northeast.
The club house of the Ottumwa Country Club. The interior space is all paneled in medium-toned wood, with lots of large windows for great views of the [outdoors], especially to the south. Today the [polo [players] and fans] are all around, swapping dirt. There are a few [golfers] having a drink at the bar, which is the one dark corner in the whole place, having the large floor-to-[ceiling] neutral colored [curtains] drawn.
"We have [everything] you need for the sports you play!" It is a large box store, one big room with high [ceilings] and separate areas for the major sports activities, football, baseball, golf, swimming, soccer and fitness training. It appears to be a bit understaffed, as you can only see one sales [clerk] for the whole store.
The county morgue. The walls and low [ceiling] are white, and there is plenty of artificial light, although you don't see any windows. It smells of bleach. Occasionally a hint of something spoiled wafts by. It feels a little cold in here. The county [coroner, Helga], is here.
A beautifully green golf course. It appears well-maintained, but empty at the moment. The tee box for the first hole is to the right and the start of the [tenth] hole is to the left. The club house is just a short walk to the north.
A magnificent view of the [haze covered city] screams directly  into your face from this vantage point. An [elegant table]     adorned with [flowers and polished sterling] is set before you. across the [table], a warm breeze rushes in from open [french    doors] revealing a rooftop [balcony].
The warm summer wind sounds like the surf rolling back into       the ocean. The [city] below is speckled with an incomprehensable   number of lights which are becoming more noticable as the         orange sky turns to black with the night. A waist-level [wrought  iron railing] wraps around the front of this smooth [cement         balcony]. You notice a few other [people] leaning against it        while [smoking] next to a [large cement ashtray] which resembles a    [birdbath]. To the west is a set of open [french doors] which        bridge the [balcony] to the dining room.
You are in the pit, as you call it. It is a deep, cylindrical room. In the middle is a [hole], where you go to the bathroom. In one part, your [bed] is fastened to the wall. Above you, the [light] shines brightly.
You are in a large room, about the size of your old high school gymnasium. In rows and columns, more prisons like your own dot the floor. Next to [each] is a machine that seems to lower a ladder. To the north is the rest of the facility.
You are at the end of this facility's hallway. To the south is a door labelled STORAGE, leading to the room in which you were trapped. To the east is a door labelled COMPUTER. To the west is a room labelled SECURITY. To the north is more hallway. You can see the exit from here. There are two [bodies] here, [both] of them wearing uniforms. One is a [tall, skinny male], laying in the middle of the hall. On the other side of the hall, next to the door marked COMPUTER, is a [black male].
Another body is here. It is a [tall], somewhat [chubby male], and is just like the other bodies. To the east is a door marked EQUIPMENT, and to the west is a door marked PRISON QUARTERS.
This is the security room, which is about the size of a bloody shoe box. One body is here, slumped in a [chair], in the same condition as the ones [outside]. It is an [older man], with indicators that he was the commander of this [facility] on his uniform. On the wall in front of you, there is an [array] of television [monitors], all of which have stopped working, and below that, a [control panel] with a scorched button. On the next wall, there is a [map] of the [facility].
You are in a room filled with computers and related [equipment], about half the size of a high school computer lab, perhaps smaller. Only a fourth of the clutter is made up of PC [parts] and computers, and they seem to be [outdated], gathered up into a [pile] and gathering dust. The rest is [unrecognizable] [equipment], some turned off, some blinking and whirring.
You are in the equipment room. On the wall opposite the door is a [rack] full of [guns, both] assault rifles and pistols. On the wall to the right of the door is a [rack] full of grotesque [masks]. On the wall to the left of the door is a locked [chest] labelled [AMMUNITION].
Brambles bristle [eight] feet high on either side. They seem to give you a penetrating glare. The [thorns] have grudgingly pulled apart to make a narrow [path] leading north; one would think the curse would have included a post-Prince closure clause, but you're not complaining.
The [drawbridge] is rather in need of repair. To the north, the castle sits sleepily in the orange afternoon sun. To the south, shadows nearly hide the path through the brambles.
Even though strewn with autumn leaves, rat droppings, and [six] varieties of moss, the [Vestibule] evokes awe. The fine [oriental rug] will command respect when de-mushroomed, and the [Grand Staircase] nobly awaits repair. Still, it's a shame they left the door open. You can go north to the Great Hall, south through the open portcullis to the drawbridge, east through an imposing door or west to an intimidating hallway.
The Great [Hall] yawns before you, a gargantuan indoor plain. Around an acre or so of oaken [table] sleeps a cornucopia of [noblemen, noblewomen], and their [attendant parasites]. You can try to go in almost any direction, but your gaze is irresistably drawn north to the high throne.
Here the table ends humbly at the High [Throne], on which are seated the unconscious [monarchs].
Here the nobility were wont to amuse themselves with diversions such as [billiards, indoor badminton, and indoor water polo]. Unfortunately, a bored giant has swooped all this, as well as a portion of the eastern wall, into a [pile of rubble].
This is the [reception] office, and you are here along with a [receptionist]; You notice a [sign] with "[Rules]" written in red letters above the [receptionist's] cash register. To the south you can see a door marked "PADDLING ROOM".
You're In The Paddling Room. Against the [wall] is the infamous [BendMaster] [5000 Restraint]. To the north is a door marked "OFFICE".
This is the foyer for the Baylor School of Punishment. Vaulted [ceilings] echo Claude King's "Wolverton Mountain" which is coming from hidden speakers. To the west you see the entrance, and hallways to the south and north marked "Paddling Hall" and "Time Out Hall", respectively.
This room is [both] dusty and musty, smelling of [milquetoast]. You see a [young man] in a dunce cap seated behind a filthy desk.
You enter the room and a [wizened old man] seated behind a oak desk says "You seek the wisdom of the [paddle]? Come and ask me what you wish!
It looks like every other lounge you've ever seen, except that there are [decorations] everywhere for Chuck D. Schmendiman's party. There are exits to the north, south, east and west.
Vulcan, [God of Hot Stuff], is here trying to fix the [thermostat].
Mercury, [God] of the [Corn Trade], is here trading [corn].
Mars, [God of War], is here playing [darts].
Bacchus, [Sponge]...errr, [God of Wine], is here drinking and drinking and drinking.
Your daily experiences in this room can be boiled down to two things: paper drudgery and computer drudgery. [Co-workers] mill around looking busy, but all you can focus is the exit out of this place to the south.
You are at the corner of [23rd and Lincoln] where a great [experiment] is about to take place. A portion of the street to the south is protected from the crowd.
Nearer a portion of the crowd, but still a safe distance away, you stand on a [sidewalk] south of 'The Experiment'. The [door] to the coffee shop, "The End of Days" is to the east.
Angry yuppies crowd the [coffee shop] with laptops, newspapers, and books by Chaucer and Domikov. The [assistant] to the [assistant] is waiting nervously for her order. The multi-colored [menu] loudly accents the [wall] behind the counter where three goatee sprouting 'helpers' assist the customers.
The baroque castle is an architectonic masterpiece, situated in the heart of the capital, and the town residence of the royal family. The paparazzi are waiting outside a door in the courtyard. The door is watched by a uniformed [guard]. You bombard him with questions about the young ones. A [car] is waiting by the door. A red lady's [bike] is leaned against the wall.
The bar is well-known for being frequented by young celebrities, not least the young members of the royal family. The paparazzi are waiting outside. A [chauffeur] is waiting in a car.
You are in a [clearing] in the [forest] outside the [College]. The entrance to the [College] is a [great dark gateway] to the south, inscribed above with the [words], "Abandon hope all ye who enter here." The [forest] surrounds you on all other sides.
You are in your [bedroom]. Your [rickety bed] sits against the [wall], buttressed by a [bedside] [table]. There is a [bookcase] on the West [wall] and a [window] to the East. A [bathroom] lies to the North and a [door] to the garage lies South. The [door] is [boarded] shut. There is a [closet] in the [wall] beside the [door].
You are in a [bathroom]. All the usual [amenities] are here: a [sink], a [toilet], a [shower] and a [medicine cabinet]. You should know... it's your [bathroom].
A [flourescent] [light fixture] is flickering and is [bothering] you. Your [desk] sits on one side of the room. A [computer] sits on the [desk], humming. Down the hall west leads to June's [office] and the company cafeteria. There is thunder and [lightning] outside, which is coming dangerously close.
This is a dull [hallway] on the third floor of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft building that leads between your office (to the east), the cafeteria (to the west) and June's office (south of here). A [Froot Loops dispenser] stands here. Stairs lead north and downstairs.
June is sitting behind a [desk] and is looking sternly at you.
The [lobby] of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft building is the one nice part of this building. Stairs lead [upward], although you'll never need to use them again as you have been fired. A receptionist's desk stands here on the floor. Double doors lead out into the thunderstorming weather.
Here, from high atop the cliffs, you can barely make [out] the [mainland] in the distance. [Everything] is dark; no lights in the cities for quite some time. Meadows stretch around you. A path you trod [out yourself] in the past months leads back south, to the crossroad. To the north, on the clifftop, sits your shack.
You stand atop the highest cliff on the island. There is a small [shack] here, housing your makeshift radio.
In the purple light of the evening, the sand looks treacherous, like quicksand. A small military boat has capsized a some distance from the shore, last night. You tried to reach it this morning, but it was too far away then. [Both] you and Verdade thought you heard screams from there at the time, but weren't sure. And now the tide has shoved it further towards the shore. It's only a short swim away.
Decay glides by your [starboard window]. The [interior] of the [bus] is typical of the few other units mournfully roaming the streets of the [city] on any given day: a middle-aged [driver] squats in the front, [advertisements] for impotence drugs and rhinoplasty and soft drinks line the [ceiling], and a number of [kids] sporting [team logos] slouch in [plastic flesh-tone] [seats].
The [interior] of the [bus] is typical of the few other units that mournfully roam the streets of the [city] on any given day: [advertisements] for impotence drugs and rhinoplasty and soft drinks line the [ceiling, and plastic flesh-tone] [seats] surround. The [bus] is stopped for the reason, you assume, that it has collided hard with something squishy.
What is unusual about what you see here is not the middle-aged [bus driver] spraying a [French tuxedoed man] in the face with explitives, the the [overturned] [buggy] down the block, nor the clearly troubled [couple] cradling one another in horror, but the four [brown horse hooves] jutting out from under the front of the [bus] at unlike [angles].
You're not lost, but this is unfamiliar [concrete] and steel. It's not all such substance, however. The northeast offers an [asphalt walk] through perpendicular [rows of shrubbery]. Trees shade the [walkway] beyond the uni-[shrubs]. [Sidewalk] rolls out from the [street] corner to the north and east.
Autumn vortices homogenize leaves and bits of litter into damp, matted piles that obscure most of the asphalt walkway stretching [both] northeast and southwest. From beyond the surrounding arbor, horns and motors accompany the ambient chirping, whistling and rustling of the park. A thin dirt path forks off to the north.
Sunlight [flittering] through a [canopy of poplar] casts a shifting [grayscale mosaic] on an intersection in the [asphalt walkway]; a warming vision on such an exceptionally personally and in most other ways dismal autumn Saturday. The [walkways] stretch out in the four diagonals.
Cars, [trucks and autos] indecisive of these genders hurry on north and east lying [streets]. You stand on the northeast corner of a block lined with tall, carefully groomed [shrubbery]. There is an opening laid with an [asphalt [walkway]] leading southwest into what you've gathered is a park. Alternatives include [sidewalk] rolling out south and west along the [streets].
A couple of [crumbling city travel [ways]] [intersect] here. Streams of [traffic]- consisting of primarily sport utility smog-o-matics -take turns roaring through. You stand on the northwest corner of a block lined neatly with tall [shrubbery]. There is an opening laid with an [asphalt [walkway]] leading southeast into reasonably dense deciduous growth. The alternative is [sidewalk] rolling out south and east along the outside of the [shrubs].
Two [streets] burrow out of sprawling urban areas and rumble together here with [traffic] spilling through at alarming speeds. You stand on the southeast corner of a block fenced by tall, even [shrubbery]. There is an opening laid with an [asphalt [walkway]] leading northwest into the shade of a leafy canopy. [Poured concrete] offers passage north and west parallel to the [traffic].
The room before you is clearly a [wizard's] quarters on board a ship. An ivory-panelled door leads starboard, presumably to the rest of the ship, while the light appears to be coming from a small [window] in the port side wall.
Where you enter your home, and also where an attacker could hide. You feel incredibly uncomfortable about this due to your limited visibility -- only the image of your front [door] cuts through the gloom. You want nothing more than to enter your home and find a place that's safe and warm.
You're at your display [table, #35]. Other [tables], with their obviously inferior [pumpkins] stretch out in all directions, an endless sea of orange.
You're at [Milton's] display [table, #24].
A deep chamber [walled] in [rock]. Light descends steeply from the oculus above, leaving a spot of [elliptical] [brilliance] on the dusty ground. The [walls] are [panelled], to a height just level with the knee: [emerald, sapphire, ovals of amethyst], shadowed and dull.
This is the Reading Room in the Auldtoon public library. The [red door] is to the south and the [white door] to the west, and an opening to the east. In the room there is a [table], and a [large window] lets in light. On the floor is the [Professor's] [briefcase].
[Frank] finds himself in an alcove. To the west is the Reading Room. [Frank] sees a [green door] to the north and also a [blue door] to south. A [red notice] is fixed to the [blue door], and there is a [small cage] in the corner of the room. A hoarse voice says: "Yo Ho Ho and a bottle of rum."
You are in the large [crop field] west of Semion, a dirt [road] leads north to the town, and another leading east into an almost dead forest. The path leading east has fresh looking [tracks] on it.
You are at the entrance to the farming town known as Semion. This place , from the look of it, probbably hasnt been visited in many years. There is a small dirt road leading south, and another leads north into town. A stone [archway] with dusty half eroded [letters] on it is [above] the entrance to town.
Most of the shop [stalls] here are destroyed, but [two] look like they may be usefull to look around in, one is to the northeast, and the other is to the west. A road leads north. Also another road leads south to Town square.
You are at the bottom of a hill that leads west and stops at the wall of a cliff. There is a small [signpost] here. A road leads east to Town square and another up the hill to the west.
This stall used to have lots of jewlry in it, but now theres mostly just empty [display cases] here. A path to the southwest takes you back to the market.
This stall is covered with extreemly old, extreemly smelly things that you hope used to be [food]. A path leads back to the market to the east.
As far as you can tell this USED to be where the people of this town lived. Now its a bunch of collapsed [piles of rotten wood]. A road leads to the market south.
Tasteful [pastels and neons] form a [concrete square] around an [anomalous growth] in the form of a [large tree]. The odd [walls and spires] surrounding give the impression of [exits] in many directions.
Stars, [galaxies, and fruits of various flavors] tumble through the [void]. Quite romantic, really, and it seems someone else had the same idea; some restaurant-style tables are scattered near the [edge] so customers can take in the view. A [sign] leans heavily on a nearby [pole]. [Roads] lead off to the northeast, east, and southeast.
One man's [market] is another man's somewhat dilapidated looking [corner] with the word "[Market]" on a [sign hanging above]. Other than that, the only indicator of such is a [cart] that probably held items once but looks pretty barren at the moment. The [pastel motif] does do a bit to lighten things up, though. [Roads] wind their way west and southeast.
You've come across a [relatively] [normal]-looking section of town; the [pastel] motif and been traded in favor of dull [browns and yellows]. A building to the north has a [sign] and a door. A building to the south has a [sign] and a place that used to have a door. Paths to the east and west have neither [signs] nor [doors].
This place does have an antique flavor to it, although you never knew the [Mayans] made [statues] made entirely of [old tires]. The [electric light] also seems to detract somewhat from the atmosphere. Still, if you like piles of [rubble] this tourist spot is quite a photo opportunity.
The [dimmed light and assorted decorations] here were probably done to set a mysterious atmosphere, but you can never tell with [people] wearing [costumes] depicting [famous moose] throughout [history sitting cross-legged] on the ground [engrossed] in a speech being given by a [fierce-looking] [lady] who occasionally beats on the large [bowl] in front of her for emphasis.
You are [seated] in your [armchair]. The [picture-frame] rests on your [lap]. In the [periphery] of your vision you can see something of your [living room] - the [wood stove], a [window].
A wierd phospherescent [smoke] covered the area, catching several [hues] from an unknown [light source]. A charge was in the air, as if [lightning] were about to strike. The hairs on the back of my neck were erect. I had this terrible feeling that at any moment someone would wander up and ask me to dance.
The [beam] prevented me from moving - It's like my brain was cut off from my body.
I'm at one side of my rather large [bedroom]. It is, by rights, a lounge - but I sleep here to keep the rent cheap. The queen sized double [bed] takes a dominant postion, mostly because it's the only comfortable thing to sit on. A few tatty [posters] line the [walls] and to the northeast is a [window] with drawn [curtains].
I am next to my [television] [set], where I often spend time trying to blank out my thoughts. Sometimes it works for a while, sometimes it makes things worse. Even tempered person that I am, however, I have thus far refrained from destroying it.
I am by the only [door] to my room. There is a large [desk] beside the [door] which I keep neurotically neat, not because I'm a particularly tidy person, more because Stinky the cat has a [tendency] to willfully destroy [anything] light enough to be manipulated by paws.
I'm standing beside my [window]. I often take breaks here, looking out onto the rest of the world and strumming my [guitar]. I suppose I should learn some songs someday.
This is the top left corner of the room - from the TV's perspective on the other side. I've got a [wardrobe] of some antiquity here - which I use for the illicit purpose of hiding fashion       crimes. It's quite a nice [wardrobe] - sort of 1940s and itinerant.
I am standing before a large [bookcase]. A very large [bookcase]. It towers over me, filled with my collection of literature. The spines of the [books] look like an abstract picture composed of numerous, irregularly shaped rectangles.
The queen sized double [bed] takes a dominant position, mostly because it's the only comfortable thing to sit on.
There is a large [desk] beside the [door] which I keep neurotically neat, not because I'm a particularly tidy person, more because Stinky the cat has a [tendency] to wilfully destroy [anything] light enough to be manipulated by paws.
I've got a [wardrobe] of some antiquity here - which I use for the illicit purpose of hiding fashion crimes.
Leaves rustle in the spring breeze, and the soft calls of distant birds add a pleasant background. The barnyard is filled with [muck]. Nearby, a splintery old [post] juts from the [mud]. A rusty old [cowbell] hangs from the [post].
This [clearing] used to be the site of a [house], where a team of scientists, who were studying the planet, lived. This is no longer the case, as the [house] has burned down. The fire is probably the reason for the colony being [out] of contact, but you are not sure it is the whole reason, as something does not feel right here. The [ashes] from the [house] cover the [ground], along with various [twisted metal pieces]. [Weeds] are popping up everywhere, as the [jungle] reclaims the area. The [clearing, and ruins], continues to the north and west.
The [ashes] from the [house] only cover a small segment of this [corner]. [Weeds and dirt patches] cover most of the [ground] instead, with what looks like the [remains] of a [garden]. There is nothing left to tell what was growing here before the fire, as any crops have completely disappeared. Maybe the scientists were not very good [gardeners], and there were no crops. However, you think that this is unlikely, as the crops they use on [new] colonies are virtually unkillable. The [clearing, and ruins], continues to the south and west.
The [ruins] continue in this [corner] of the [clearing]. A [puddle of leaking water] has formed in a [hole]. It is probably where the [water] storage for the kitchen and bathroom was located. It has been policy for [water] to be brought in from off-planet, since an unfortunate incident with an alien species that mainly consisted of [water]. The wetness of the area seems to have protected the [wood] a little better here than in the other [corners], with a few [portions] lying on the [ground]. The [clearing, and ruins], continues to the north and east.
A large [tree] dominates this section of the [clearing], with a [low hanging], yet [out] of reach, [branch above] where the [house] used to be. It would have been just [above] the roof of a one-storey section of the [house]. However, it is now only [above ashes]. This [tree] must be tough and strong to have survived the chemical process used to create a [clearing]. The chemicals are supposed to clear [everything] in preparation for the [houses and gardens] of any colonists. The [clearing, and ruins], continues to the south and east.
This is the [entrance] to Everett's place. To the east is a large passage to the dance floor.
You're in a small, smooth-walled room with barely enough area to stand. A pair of simple [bunk beds] occupy most of the cramped space. There is a [panel] near the [door]. A faint smell of [ozone] is coming from the [vent] high [above] the [beds]. The pirates must have started some electrical fires. The only [door] is north, but it's closed and locked.
It contains little more than a [bed], a closet and a PC.
The lovely pink [walls] of your bedroom reflect back the Little Mermaid nightlight you got when you were 11. The top of your [dresser] is a mess, as usual, and the [papasan chair] in the corner is piled high with your stuffed animals. The door to the south leads to the rest of the house.
The bridge is bright and shiny. [Buttons and dials] and flashing [lights] adorn every [surface]. In the middle is a [chair], on which sits the most hideous monster you have ever seen. A stairway leads back down to the hold, and there is an emergency escape to the east.
This is your room. Well, to be honest, it's really more like a [pit]. You sleep on a [pile of moldy] animal [pelts], with the [animals] still inside them. It ain't pleasant, but it's your home. Chet has rigged up a [bell] here so he can ring it whenever he needs your assistance. A [rickety ladder] leads out.
The Royal [Kitchen] is always higgeldy-piggledy and today is no different. [Chefs and serving maidens] mill about, juggling various food items and flinging them with impeccable aim into [pots and pans]. You are at the southern end of the [kitchen], which not as aromatic or as effecient as the rest. In fact, it is quite dingy and reeks of spoiled [meat]. A [large wooden door] provides an exit to the east. A [smaller] [door] heads southwest. There is a [pit] in the floor leading down to your sleeping quarters.
This is a steep metal [gangway] connecting [Deck] Eight, above, and [Deck] Nine, below.
[Ensign] First Class [Blather] is standing before you, furiously scribbling demerits onto an oversized clipboard. A [massive] explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. [Blather], looking slightly disoriented, [barks] at you to resume your assigned duties. "I said to return to your post, [Ensign] Seventh Class!" bellows [Blather], turning a deepening shade of crimson.
[Gangway] This is a steep metal [gangway] connecting [Deck] Eight, above, and [Deck] Nine, below.
Deck Eight This is a featureless corridor leading port and starboard. A [gangway] leads down, and to fore is the Hyperspatial Jump Machinery Room.
Brig You are in the Feinstein's brig. [Graffiti] cover the walls. The cell [door] to the south is [locked].
It's a bit dark back here, making it a challenege to walk from the west side of the floor to the east without stepping on [discarded props] or tripping over [boxes of leftover costumes]. A [large sheet of plywood] leans against the west [wall]. The [curtain] is directly to the south, and is the only thing that separates you from the award ceremony taking place right now. There are dressing rooms to the northwest, north, and northeast.
The small dressing room has very little along the lines of personal effects, as it's used by a different actor [each] day. Most of the scant space is taken up by a [table and mirror]. A [lamp] is [chained] to the [wall].
Your [brother Sam] is sitting across from you.
You recognize a voice from far away, "Don't take that! Look in the [cabin] at the stern -- you'll find some fun there!" It sounds like [Davis].
Crash! You whirl around to see the [door] shatter, kicked by a hulking [man], his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. "Me name's Andy [Crulley], and ladies learn to love me," sniggers the pirate, advancing toward you.
He sighs, "You share your [father's] stubborn streak. I wished not to do this." He leaps to your side, hauling you up onto his shoulder, and carries you out of the [room]. [Captain] [Jamison] sets you on your feet again on the horror of the [deck].
You hear the large [cupboard] scrape, and turn to see Captain [Jamison]. "Hello! I came down to give you this -- my allotment from the coffer." He nods at the box in his arms. [Jamison] starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your [clothes], but, "Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired." He folds the pretty thing into your [hand]. "And I meant to reassure you that if the [men] suddenly abandon [ship], they are off to help me. [Rodney] will stay behind with you." He drops the coffer on the floor, smiling in farewell, and walks swiftly away.
Your [frock] suddenly catches on something, tearing the fabric. A large scrap flutters to your feet.
You can see a [rag] and a [coffer] here.
Suddenly you appreciate what it is to be a ball in an exploding cannon. The intense heat, the push of fire, and the sense of release when spit from the cannon's [mouth] -- these you feel when the [lighted] fuse finally burns up to the largest keg of gunpowder in the hold.
You've got a [bed] and a [small nightstand] here but not much else. It doesn't really look like your [bedroom], at least not the [bedroom] that you have now. It reminds you of the [bedroom] that you had as a kid. There are some [posters] on the [wall of music groups and sports heroes] that you loved when you were were younger. There's a plain white [door] set in the west [wall] of the room. The bathroom is just to the south and the kitchen is to the east.
There's just a [refrigerator] and a [sink] set into the [counter]. There are some [dishes] on the kitchen [counter] with what looks like the [remains] of last night's [dinner]. The bedroom is west from here and the living room is just to the south.
This is the living room. It looks exactly the way you've always remembered it, except... it appears to be lacking most of the furniture you remember. There's a [couch], a [coffee table], one [photograph] on the wall and that's it. Surely it didn't always look like this. Wasn't there a TV and a fireplace and.. well...it was different wasn't it? North of the living room is the kitchen and to the west is the bathroom. To the south is in open [doorway] that shimmers and distorts the view of the street behind it.
The bathroom is rather [small], like the other rooms in the house, and consists solely of a [toilet] and a [sink]. Your bedroom is north of here and the living room is to the east.
The room is small, but serviceable. The walls are devoid of any posters or pictures - you keep meaning to put some up, but you never get around to it. It still looks lived-in, though, which is a polite way of saying it's a mess. The door of your [closet] doesn't quite open all the way because of the way the [bed] is positioned, but what can you do? There was nowhere else to put it.
You "hear" a message coming in on the official message line: "PRISM? I see you're in the middle of dropping into [Simulation] [Mode]! I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to check out the, ah, potential effects of the proposed Plan for Renewed [Restaurant] Cleanliness. It's a minor thing, of course, [but] you you know, well, actually, Dr. Duncan did come down with [food] poisoning just [two] days ago and it made me realize -- [but] I'm rambling, I'm sorry. I'll let you go, because I know it's so annoying when I'm using the message line and the [simulation] actually kicks --"
Elm street passes under an [elevated roadway], a relic of the last century's interstate highway system. A Chinese [restaurant] fills the space under the highway to the south, and a [bar] is nestled under the [roadway] north of here. Elm leads eastward, to [downtown], and westward toward the [suburbs].
This is a small Chinese restaurant, crowded with [students].
This noisy lounge is a favorite hangout for students from the nearby college. [Battered wooden stools] are the only seating. The only exit is south.
You are at the north end of the [market] of Alexandria, a large [square] of brown dust in the middle of the city. During the day, the place is packed with merchants displaying their goods on carts or rugs, buskers and customers. But now the sun is going down, and the place is almost completely deserted and all the [storefronts] seem to be closed. The [market] continues to the east, west and south, and the city's [main street] leads away to the north.
The market continues to the west, north and south, and a dirty [alley] leads to the east.
This [small] hotel has no doubt seen better days, but was never anything impressive, even in its prime. The front [desk, vending machine] and single [couch] seem to jostle [each] other for space in the tight confines of the lobby. A single bare bulb provides harsh lighting, and the ancient [carpet] covering the floor is covered in all manner of [stains]. Behind the front [desk], a narrow [stairway] leads upstairs.
You are in a narrow, dimly-lit hallway, which gives access to the hotel's rooms: all [four] of them. The hallway is only about fifteen feet long, with [two doors] on either side. It terminates in a [grimy window] at one end and a [stairway] down to the lobby at the other.
The market continues to the east, north and south, and a dusty [alley] leads to the west.
This short, broad alley is dusty and dirty, but falls short of the degree of squalor usually found in alleys in this section of the city. The near-total lack of litter and graffiti suggests that the city's public servants have recently sent a work gang of convicted criminals to clean the alley up. The buildings flanking the alley have wisely been constructed so as to have no ground floor [windows] bordering on the alley; the lowest [windows] are about fifteen feet off the ground. Stacked against one [wall] of the alley is a neat pile of [wooden crates].
You are standing precariously at the very top of the pile of wooden crates, with the dusty floor of the alley over ten feet below you. Being up here puts you in easy reach of a small [window] in the [wall] of the north building.
You are in the southwest corner of the market of Alexandria, a large square of brown dust in the middle of the city. Nestled in a corner between buildings is an area floored with [stone tiles]. In the middle is a [fountain], which hasn't operated in as long as you can remember.
It seems that not even Alexandria is immune to the urban decay which plagues all major cities. This alley is a testament to the darker side of urban life. Broken [hypodermic] [syringes] litter the ground, [needles] gleaming dimly in the fading twilight, and strange [graffiti] is scrawled on the [walls] in flaking [paint].
A large [pile of garbage bags] is stacked in a corner where the alley ends in a brick [wall].
The market continues to the north, east and west and the city [slums] lie to the south.
Everything is in perfectly in order here---[white] and austere, as I like it. The [door] to the hallway lies to the south, and [windows border] the other three sides of the [room].
A tiny, dank space beyond my decorative abilities to remedy. Leo's [painting] on the west [wall] is just sufficiently distracting so that one might not notice the total lack of [windows], at least. The stairs down lie to the east, my bedroom is north, and the toilet is southwest.
This is the landing of the [stairwell], which makes a broad 180-degree turn between upstairs and downstairs. A wide shaft of morning [sunlight] streams in through the [picture window] which makes up most of the eastern [wall], and the [staircases] lie to the west.
What until last week was my main living space is at the moment a complete disaster. The [walls] are painted a sickly [turquoise], new as of two days ago, and all the [furniture] is still covered with [plastic]. Currently the only thing I've put back up is another of Leo's [paintings], on the west [wall]. The front [door] lies to the southwest, the [key] in the [lock]. The [stairs] up to the bedroom are to the east, the kitchen north.
This [room] also has [windows] on three sides, and features splendid views of the garden and the [pond]. Aside from the usual kitchen [accessories], I've got a little [table] here, and some [cabinets].
You're standing near the [side] of a [frozen lake]. [Boys and girls] from the village are ice-skating on the [lake]. A snow-covered path leads northwest around the [lake] and east into the village.
Some [ice-skates], probably forgotten by someone, lie [beneath] the [old willow].
This is the place you have lived in for the last month and a bit. It was all you could afford with the [small] pay you gleaned from countless rubbish jobs. Looking back, you should have looked [harder]. The [walls] are unpapered, the floor uncarpeted, and the room itself only contains a [narrow, hard bed], a [dresser] and a [small television].
The bathroom is long deserted. A [urinal] stands in one corner; from the looks of it, Nostradamus [himself] was likely the last person to use it. The attic is back to the west.
Every last inch of wall space here, save for the [window], is plastered with needless decor: nature caricatures, inspirational glurge, [posters] with cartoon letters and plus signs. The floor's no better; the brats didn't pick up when Miss Lauren told them to pick up and now it's cluttered with gaudy [plastic]. The [books] are tossed into the [carpet square pile] and someone's dripped [tempera paint] onto every [table]. And there's more, it seems, every second. [Leaves and dirt] by the doorway. Shredded [paper] that's not in the waste [bin].
The open-air platform at the top of the Eiffel Tower is continually swept with high winds, and you find yourself having a difficult time standing in one place without bracing yourself. [Metal] supports rise at the four corners of the platform to complete the peak of the tower above you.
This bathroom, marked with a flourished "W.C." on the door, contains a fancy porcelain [toilet and washbasin - both] of which are, unfortunately, caked with the grime of years of heavy use and little cleaning. The door leads west to the base of the Tower.
You are standing on your basic [suburban street], exactly like every [suburban street] you've ever seen. To the north, beyond a [hedge], is the front [lawn] of your recently-purchased white house, [both] exactly like their counterparts on either side. The bland sameness is enough to drive you stark raving bonkers.
You're in a [dark alley]. There is a [garbage bin] in front of you and a doorway behind. The [alley] itself leads north-south.
You're in [Studio] A, the home of the network special "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" The show is about to begin taping. The [audience] is full and [Regis Philben] is in his chair talking to a [contestant].
Your apartment is very barely furnished. You don't [bother] to put anything in, since you can just get the holodeck to conjure up whatever room you want. Except you can't right now, because it's jammed on random cartoon mode, and is to the south. The open front door is east.
This is just a simple hall, with rather fetching hypercube-pattern [wallpaper]. It continues to the north (toward stinky June's apartment), the door to your apartment is to the west, and stairs lead down.
Here the hall gets considerable stinkier, as you approach [June's apartment], to the north.
Mrs. King's Third Grade Classroom; The epitome of ennui. The room, decorated entirely in tan, beige, light yellow, and other shades of dull, is filled with eight and nine year old kids who would rather be somewhere else. The door and only window, which looks out onto the playground, are on the north wall. At the front of the classroom, Mrs King herself is lecturing and using what is certainly more chalk than the public school budget has allocated to her. You are seated at a [desk] that is too small even for your puny eight year old frame. Their are students to your left, right, front, and back. Indeed, your [desk] is completely surrounded by other [desks] that are just the same. You sit in a group of dusty little [desks], all alike.
It's rather chilly at this time of night, and you would rather be inside. You can't seem to avoid the gaze of the [carved pumpkin] that sits here.
The [jack] o'[lantern] sits on the stoop with its evil grin.
Before you can do anything, the [band] explodes into action. The crowd coalesces into a single entity and leans towards them, falls back, ripples spastically. Being part of this lurching creature makes your spine tingle.
Your [room] is a mess -- [posters] slowly peel off the [walls] to join the small [heaps of clothes] that spot the floor like death [mounds]. There's a path south through the [junk] from your [bed] to your bathroom, one going north to the rest of the house.
I am wandering in a [dream-world]. Nearby, I hear the sound of babbling [voices]. Exit East.
Neither heaven nor hell, this place exists to purge your [soul] of the sins you committed during your time on earth. The fires burn and lick at your astral body and peck away at the little an not-so-little things you rather not admit to yourself. You see a [blue light] above you in the only direction you can go from here.
You are in the temple of western civilisation: your living-room. Standing by the eastern [wall] is its shrine: the [television] [set]. South is a doorway to the kitchen, and your brother's workshop/bedroom is to the east.
This room is a mess. The [walls] are lined, clockwise starting with the north, with a desk, a desk, and your brother's unmade [bed]. Above the [bed] is a [notice board] where Karl has pinned lots of [papers] with [diagrams and sketches] of machines on. The [desks] are cluttered with many electronic [devices], tools, [wires] etc. Karl has made this [bedroom] his own little [techno]-freak heaven. You, however, have never been interested in this kind of [stuff].
Besides being a kitchen, this room also acts as a hallway between the living-room to the north and the front [entrance] to the south. A small [table] with two [chairs] stands by a [window] in the western [wall], opposite the [sink], a couple of [cupboards], and a large antique [cast-iron] [stove] alongside the eastern [wall]. Your brother's majestic grand-father [clock] made of [heavy metal] is by the living-room [doorway].
This certainly isn't your home machine, and it's not Fraunhofer's dirty works either. You've got to get back on the job! You're currently standing on an unpleasantly warm and prickly [Pentium heatsink]. Off to the south you can see a bunch of PCI cards, and to the north is the front face of the computer.
Little blinky [lights] are all over the place up here, reporting internal goings-on to the outside world. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an exit, so you can only retreat back to the south.
Even though you know full well what you will see, you turn to survey the surroundings. Pretty town square, yup... nondescript... nondescript town... In fact, [everything] that your eye lands on starts with N. Nasturtiums. Nifty narwhals. Nine Nairobian nephews. Needlessly nickel-plated napkin-dispensers. Nick, nastily suing for copyright violation!! !
You are in the yard of Lowell prison. A big, wide open gate leads [outside] to the north.
As you walk down the northwest corridor, the phrase "THIS HALL SELECTS EASY SKILL" mysteriously pops into your head. Directly in front of you to the north is a [slipgate] which pulsates mysteriously. Carved into [each] side is the word "EASY". There is a [stained glass window] here depicting a flaming [torch], which, in an odd bit of artistic redundancy, is directly opposite an actual flaming [torch]. The opening of the structure you came from lies behind you to the southeast.
You emerge from the [slipgate] into a room with four hallways. To the West, a [metallic] frame beckons you, with bright red [arrows] pointing to it, making you wonder why on Earth someone would [bother] putting bright red [arrows] on a doorway. To the Northwest is an oddly shaped doorway covered in some sort of [latticework], with checkered [stone steps] leading you into a gothic hallway. To the Northeast is a box-like doorway adorned with what can only be described as "Gothic Aztec" [wallpaper], and a pair of pseudo-Nordic [runes]. And to the East is a plain old [wooden] doorway, with plain old [wooden steps]. You can see the flickering light from a [torch] coming down its hallway.
You walk up the rather dull [wooden steps] to come to a plain room with two flickering [torches] and a big [pool of water] in the center. As you approach, the words "THIS IS THE FOURTH EPISODE: THE ELDER WORLD. YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES COME TRUE..." appears in your mind.
You find yourself in a room with three corridors, [each] leading to a slipgate. On either side of you are stone [pyres], their flames flickering softly. Directly in front of you is a metal [structure] with the word QUAKE carved into it. The [structure] splits into three corridors, to the northwest, north and northeast respectively.
As you make your way into the north corridor, the phrase "THIS HALL SELECTS NORMAL SKILL" manifests itself in front of you. The effect is quite disconcerting. To the north is a pulsating, rectangular [slipgate] with the word "NORMAL" etched on [each] side. To your right and left are stone carvings of some sort of [demon]. The path you followed to get here lies behind you to the south.
As you walk towards the door, the thick metal frames swing open, disappearing into the [walls] on either side of you. You follow the metal bridge around the corner and up, eventually coming to an empty and poorly lit room containing a single, rusted [slipgate] in front of you to the north.
You are standing in a dingy room with flickering lights. There are [tools] everywhere and [wooden] [planks] scattered across the floor. The [slipgate] you entered through lies directly behind you to the south.
You walk past the lattice archway into a gray corridor with flickering [torches] and a [checkerboard] floor. As you make your way down the hallway, the words "THIS IS THE SECOND EPISODE: THE REALM OF BLACK MAGIC. ANCIENT CASTLES AND STRANGE BEASTS AHEAD..." pops into your head. There is a large [metal door] directly to the North at the end of the hallway, and the way you came in beckons to the southeast.
A [projector] is in the room and plays a very informative video about Muffin history, you fall asleep for part of it. You wake up and hear it say "Lengend tells of a Muffin so powerful when eaten you will grow an epic HANDLEBAR MOUSTACHE of amazingness!" The rooms exit is to the south.
It's damp dark. [Horatio] is here telling you go down. The graffiti on the wall reads:  THE MUFFIN WILL BE IN THE THRID CUP!
This passge goes northwest and southeast. A [dead body] is here.
You weren't quite sure what you were expecting. [Crowds], sure, but not [ten thousand people] crammed into a [tenth] as [many] square feet until they ferment. They're sort of herded along by [barriers and signs], but once you reach critical [mass] of a couple [thousand], it just looks like an enormous [mass]. Fortunately, you made it to the end of the line. Unfortunately, so did [Brody].
A [dark tower] rises high above you, lit dimly in the [cloud]-obscured [moonlight]. The sound of a [waterfall] is nearby but somewhat muted by the high [walls] of the [fortress]. To your south is the main [courtyard], and directly west of you is the face of the [cliff] into which the [fortress] was built.
Completely covered in [cobblestones], the central [courtyard] is an [enormous] place, used for assembling the troops and greeting royalty. A large entryway is topped by an [enormous stone arch]. It leads to the east where, hidden somewhere beyond the [outer] portcullis, Apaman awaits your return. To the south and to the north rise the two [watchtowers], and it is in the northern one that Apaman believes the star rock to be. West is the entrance to the [Festning] itself, dug [out] of the rock of this mountain. Although you're hiding as best as you can in the shadows, it's dangerous to remain here long.
Suddenly, the [ship] lurches to one side, throwing you off balance.
You can see a [rag] here.
You are now in the [driveway] [entrance]. You are standing at the foot of the [driveway], the [entrance] to the [Linder] property. The entire [lot] is screened from the street and the neighbors by a wooden [fence], except on the east side, which fronts on dense bamboo [woods]. The [house] looks like a mixture of California life-style and numerous Asian influences. From here you can see the [driveway] leading north and, beyond that, the front [door].
You are now in the side [yard]. This is a little-used side [yard], hidden from the street by the [fence]. The back [yard] lies to the east and the [driveway] to the west.
You are now on the [office path]. You are on a [path] made of stepping stones, which leads from the back [gate] at the south to [Linder's] [office] at the north. In the east you can see a thick [woods]. To the west is the side [yard].
You are now on the [office porch]. You are standing on a small wooden deck outside [Linder's] [office]. A sign between the [door] and the [window] reads "PACIFIC TRADE [ASSOCIATES]". To the north is a tidy [lawn], extending east to the edge of the [woods]. A [path] of stepping stones leads south to the back [gate]. Without warning, lightning flashes above, and a few seconds later thunder rattles the [house].
([office porch]) You are standing on a small wooden deck outside [Linder's] [office].
([office path]) You are on a [path] made of stepping stones, which leads from the back [gate] at the south to [Linder's] [office] at the north.
(side [yard]) This is a little-used side [yard], hidden from the street by the [fence].
([driveway]) The [driveway], paved with peastone, runs from the [entrance] at the south end in a curve to a two-[car garage] at the east end. North of you is the front [porch], the [entrance] to the [house].
The [driveway], paved with peastone, runs from the [entrance] at the south end in a curve to a two-[car garage] at the east end.
(front [porch]) The front [porch] is in an alcove, [sheltered] from the [weather] by the [walls] and overhanging roof. A yellowish electric light hangs near the closed front [door] to the east, giving you a dim view of the [driveway] to the south and the front [yard] behind a [gate] to the north. The [gate] is closed. A [door bell] glows at you, almost daring you to ring it.
The front [porch] is in an alcove, [sheltered] from the [weather] by the [walls] and overhanging roof.
([garage]) The [garage], like a [car] port, has no [door] to keep the [cars] in.
The [walls] are decorated with spare tires and things. One [car] is a sporty red MG [convertible]. The other [car] is a dark blue [Bentley] 3.5-liter [sedan].
Someone jumps into her [car], starts it up, and races out the [driveway], leaving a wake of peastone behind her.
Oil spots on the floor [show] that a [car] is often parked here.
Suddenly, your assistant, Sgt. [Duffy], appears from out of nowhere. "Hello, [Detective]! I thought I should come here on the streetcar, in [case] you needed [help]. I'll be nearby if you want me." He disappears just as quickly.
The [garage], like a [car] port, has no [door] to keep the [cars] in.
([driveway] [entrance]) You are standing at the foot of the [driveway], the [entrance] to the [Linder] property.
The [house] looks like a mixture of a California bungalow and East Asian influences.
You are now on the [driveway].
([office] porch) You are standing on a small concrete slab outside [Linder's] [office].
You are standing on a small concrete slab outside [Linder's] [office].
You are on a neatly [manicured] [lawn], east of [Monica's] [bedroom]. The [lawn] extends east to the edge of the [woods]. From here you can go to a [rock garden] in the north or the entrance to [Linder's] [office] in the south. There's a [door] into the [house], and a [window].
(rock [garden]) This is a rock [garden] in the Japanese style, east of [Linder's] [bedroom]. A few smooth round [boulders] lie partly buried in a [bed] of gravel, which is [carefully] [raked] to be reminiscent of flowing [water]. A sequence of smaller [rocks] forms a zig-zag path from the [bedroom] [door] to the south edge of the [garden], where the [lawn] begins. There's a [door] into the [house], and a couple of [windows].
This is a rock [garden] in the Japanese style, east of [Linder's] [bedroom].
(back yard) You are on a neatly [manicured] [lawn], east of [Monica's] [bedroom].
Without warning, a [car] roars to life and speeds out of the [driveway].
Someone enters the property through the back [gate].
Someone is to the south, [heading] toward the south. The [visitor] disappears out the back [gate].

This is the place where you prepare food. And by "prepare food", of course, I mean "[microwave] frozen burritos" and "call for pizza". It's fitted [out] with all the usual amenities: [refrigerator], [stove, microwave, cabinets], a [large disembodied] [brain floating] in the [corner]. Pretty much your standard IF protagonist's kitchen. The living room is to the east.
Everyone is here! [Lisa's] settled into the [big armchair, Thor] is hanging [out] on the [couch], Mindo is -- well, Mindo's still in the kitchen, but he'll come in when the [movie] starts, undoubtedly. You've already got the DVD in your [combination] [TV/DVD player], so you just need to turn it on and late night [movie] night can begin!
A thin [beam of sunlight] illuminates this shabby [hut] just enough to see what a mess it really is. [Wood planks] wildly [nailed] together, [frozen drops of tar] on the [roof] serve to show what [dogs] are worth to their masters nowadays. A [somewhat rectangular] [hole] in the [eastern wall] leads [outward].
In the beginning, the [humans] used to trim the lawn to a neat appearance, but eventually, seeing what you did to their efforts, they gave it up.
The [lawn] continues southward, while the ways east and west are blocked with [dense bushes] and a [high, gated] [fence], respectively. Within the [bushes], a [tight hole] seems to lead into a [hollow].
Here, the [branches] of a [tall tree] provide cool shade on sunny days and some basic protection from rain and snow on the less-than-sunny days.
The [lawn] is west, southward are the [remains] of a [shed], and the way north is blocked by [dense bushes].
The [entrance door] has a [smaller door inlet] in the lower part, now [nailed] shut because the cat used to enter the [house] through it. [Scratchmarks] of a very young [dog's] [paws] decorate most of the [door] and the [walls] next to it.
The southern part of the lawn looks much like the northern part. Apart from the latter, you could visit an [ancient shed] to the east, or stroll along the [house] to the northeast.
You are standing amidst what was once a tool shed. Now, however, [everything] has fallen apart. The [lawn] is west and northwest, and the [house] front lies to the north.
The lawn stretches southward and northward here. To the northwest is the [fence] of the [herb garden], east is the [house], and west is your [hut]. The way northeast is blocked by [dense bushes].
The [dormitory] is a small, frequently claustrophobic room that somehow fits four [bunkbeds], which are stacked up on opposite [walls]. There is a [sink] in one corner and an old [wardrobe] in another. The [doorway] leads east. A solitary [window] allows a cold light into the room.
A large tribunal hall. At one end there is the [judges'] [bench]; on the east side a [gate] separates the hall from the defendants' [cage]. South of here is the large [portal] opening to the rest of the world. The hall is full of [people] who came here eager to know the result of the trial and are now murmuring loudly.
Oh, the room? There's a bed that's been slept in way too often, unaltered by the housekeepers since your last nap. There's a hotel chain's idea of a workdesk, a doorway into the bathroom at the southeast end of the room, a walk-in closet to the east, the door to the hallway in the northwest corner. Gillian your editor, bless her heart, instructed them to remove the t.v. A minibar stands on the [wall].
Your rather paltry [wardrobe] is stacked, suspended or flung in this dim space, plus a face-level [shelf] containing your [suitcase] and a [thin cardboard box].
Rachel's [bedsit] is [small] and sparsely furnished, but is certainly nicer than living at home with Mum and Dad. Her boyfriend bought it [six] months ago, and although he hasn't given it to her, he's quite happy for her to treat it as her own. It's just this one room with a tiny bathroom attached. To go to work she'll need to go [out], but not until she's dressed. In the room is her [bed, desk] and a [bedside] [cabinet]. A [small wardrobe] for her clothes is in the corner.
Actually this is simply a wet shower room, with a [tiny sink] and a [shelf] for her [toileteries]. Rachel likes to shower [each] morning.
This is apparently somebody's personal library. The east and south [walls] are covered in [bookshelves]; against the north [wall], between two curtained [windows], stands a large [desk]. On the [desk], a [small computer] sits in the [light] that falls, filtered to a soft, book-friendly [haze], through the [curtains]. The only exit is a [door] in the west [wall], which is otherwise bare except for a large [painting].
The book on the round, maroon table is looking at you. In this sunny May afternoon, you wanted to read the book and be [outside] also. So you took it and came to this coffee house. You are wondering what the protagonist will do next.
The [walls] are covered with [posters]. A [small desk] stands next to the [window]. It is half-buried under [piles of comics], [papers] and other [stuff]. A [large white cupboard] stands next to the door in the west [wall]. Next to the [pine bed] is a [nightstand].
A distant [thud] outside your [cell] brings you to your feet, cursing softly as you come up [short against] your [chains]. From down the corridor you hear muffled [voices] and the sounds of shuffling feet. There is a pause, silence, and you wait. Soon a brilliant glow appears, [throwing] the [bars] into stark relief, blinding you to [what lies] beyond. Squinting, you turn your head away, your eyes unaccustomed to the [light].
There is little to see in the flickering [light]: [stone] walls, a [bare] [dirt] floor, and a [stout friar] standing nervously before you.
The room is frightfully [dark], save for pale streams of red [light] shining through various [holes] in the [ceiling]. [Shadows] lurk around objects, forming vague outlines of unknown [monstrosities]. There are no windows, just [four wooden walls] around you, a weak fortress you hope will hold. And of course... the [door] to the [outside].
Soft cedar wood cushions your feet, as you stand in your [bedroom]. Splendid is the only word that escapes your gate of teath. Your studies tell you that perfection is a fool's impossibility, [but] this room is truly your paradise, refuge and sanctuary. A massive [canopy bed] clings to the southern wall, facing the door. Besides the [bed] lies a a small [drawer], with a gas lamp sitting on it, just so. A small persian rug sits as an isolated in the center of the room, taking away from its rather Spartanesque atmosphere that you love nevertheless.
The [bed] is quite comfy, as usual. The lamp is within an arm's reach.
It's dark outside. A firm [rain] is falling and the air is damp and misty. The [road] continues north to the [main gate] and south back to the [main road]. A [small path] goes east.
You hide in the shadows of the trees beside the [road]. Just ahead of you, to the north lies the [main gate] to Meramax. There are two [armed guards] outside the [gate] and probably more of them in the [small building] next to it. The [road] continues back to the south.
It's very dark here. You can barely make out a [small shed] to the north. Beside the [shed] is a [pile of metal junk] and next to that is a [heap of sand]. The [path] continues east, deeper into the [forest]. The road that you came from is to the west.
This was your private room until last Spring when Mommy brought home the new [baby] from the hospital. Now IT sleeps here too. One exit, east, leads into the hallway. Mommy told you to [stay] here and take your nap. But she's downstairs taking her own nap, so you can do whatever you want.
The long hall runs south from here. Your bedroom is to the west. Your playroom is to the east. The [thick carpet] here is [warm] against your bare feet.
To the east is the [closet door].
The long hall runs north from here. To the south, a [wooden child gate] across the top of the [stairs] protects you, but prevents you from continuing in that direction. Your Daddy's office is to the west, and the upstairs bathroom to the east.
The bathroom [walls] are [painted] teal. Black and [white] large [square tiles] checkerboard the floor. A [towel rack] is mounted to the wall. A [porcelain bathtub, sink and toilet] are [simple] and matching in their functional design.
You are in your history classroom. There are 25 cramped [student] [desks] lined in rows of [five], all facing the [chalk board] up front. The [teacher's] [table], which is barely larger than a [student] desk, sits in front and off to one side. A row of permanently sealed, [shatter-resistant windows] look [out] onto the [parking lot]. As dull a sight as that grey [parking lot] might be, you marvel at how many long hours you've spent [staring] at it from this room. Your door to freedom is due east.
The school's long main corridor [stretches] far to the north, but widens just south of here where it opens into the building's front lobby. The floor along the entire length of this corridor (and throughout the building) is [tiled] in a checkerboard of orange and burnt sienna squares. The [lockers], long [rows] of them on either side, come in a [single] shade of olive. Your history room is immediately to the west.
[Classrooms] and olive [lockers] are on either side. The chemistry room is on the west. A [locked classroom] is on the east. The floor is [tiled] in a checkerboard of orange and burnt sienna. The hall extends a long way to the north and a short way to the south.
Rows of [lockers] are on either side. The [student] bathroom is on the east. A [locked classroom] is on the west. The floor is [tiled] with the same orange [tile] which extends a short way to the north, and a longer way to the south.
The school's main corridor widens here into a tiled [lobby]. You can return to the main corridor by going north, access the [athletic wing] to the northeast, or exit the building through a [set] of doors to the southwest. Other insignificant [exits] to the [less important wings] of the building have already been sealed off for the afternoon.
A long yellow [school bus] idles here, spewing thick clouds of diesel exhaust fumes.
Aisle upon aisle of vented purple [gym lockers], separated by long [orange plastic benches] create a maze-like atmosphere in this athletic changing room. Fortunately you are already familiar with the layout, having beaten several recent escapes from the [aggressive] [bullies] who typically lurk here. You can return to the school's main corridor to the northwest and southwest, or seek refuge in the [janitor's] [office] to the south. A prominent [red EXIT sign] to the east marks the way [out] to the ball fields.
To the north is a [steel] [fire door] into the [library]. The [fire door] is securely [locked].
To the southeast there is an access to the gym. The [library] entrance is to the north. The floor here is [tiled] in the same orange [tile] as you've seen throughout this school. You're really beginning to hate that color. The rest of the corridor extends far, far, far to the south.
[School] is to the northeast. To the west, just off campus, is the Quickie Mart convenience [store].
The [Janitor's] office is more 'closet' than 'office'. Several [shelves] of dangerous [cleaning chemicals] line the walls. Mr. [Sanchez] is here, inventorying his [supplies].
This is a [dank [solitary]] [confinement] [cell], no more than [two] meters on [each] side. The [ceiling] is so low that you must constantly [stoop] to keep your head from brushing the mildewed [ceiling]. The walls are [solid] [poured concrete].
It's all prepared for you. The stage, so barren, lit only by the glow of the [PowerPoint] above you and the backstage lights to the north. The [audience], south of you, doing their best to look rapt. And you, standing in the center of it all, small and [curtailed]. After [two] hours of presentation, it's [seven] o'clock. Dinner was scheduled for 6:30. You have become irrelevant.
You didn't really familiarize [yourself] with the auditorium before going on stage. So all you see are doors arranged haphazardly and various other [furniture]. All that you care about is the kitchen door to the west.
This auditorium is apparently used for so many receptions, there's a built-in kitchen. That's fine with you. You like convenience. It's got all the standard accoutrements: [dishwasher], [shelves, stove, sink, counter]. What it doesn't have is the kitchen staff that makes all of it useful.
You are stood on a small country lane. The lane winds off east and northwest into the distance. Up on a hill to the southwest, you can see the [outline] of the [Abbey] (what's left of it). To the south is the entrance via the gate.
This little garden seems quite claustrophobic. To the east is what you presume to be the front [door], with a [conservatory] directly south. The path comes in from the road to the north and swings westward.
This is a small path, running east to west. [Trees] surround the rest of the path, but a [shed] protrudes slightly from the south.
You are stood at the entrance to the [graveyard]. The wrought iron railings stand tall to the east, in the middle of which is a large open gateway. The rest of the [graveyard] extends westwards.
This area of the [graveyard] is fairly bare. There is a small patch of grass that has been dug up. To the east is a large gate taking you back to the house, and to the west is some sort of small building.
You are stood in what looks like the centre of the [graveyard]. To the west, you can see a large crypt rising before you. Back to the east is the rest of the [graveyard], and brambles and trees grow all around.
You are standing in the [ring] of one of the greatest [robot] boxing [stadiums] in the entire world. Thousands of screaming [fans] have packed the [arena] to see your match. It's time for the fight to end it all.
Your eyes try to focus on anything, but fail. There's nothing here but you. All you can see is [static snow], like from an untuned television. It's above you, below you - all around you. A terrible din like a hundred hissing cobras fills your ears.
But victory's not here yet. You still have a lot of work to do. After all, it's like Marx said: It's one thing to interpret the world but the point is to change it. And today, change will come! Now if only you could find your [Revolutionary] To-Do List...
In future generations, this building may well be a museum, for this is where the People's [Committee] for the Revolution made their glorious plans to liberate all who are oppressed! The [red light] that illuminates the room might cause eye strain and make it hard to work, but it is truly inspiring. You can exit the [headquarters] to the west (how appropriate!) and a [staircase] leads downwards to the lab.
The only exit is up the [stairs] back to the rest of the [Headquarters].
You can exit the [headquarters] to the west and a [staircase] leads downwards to the lab.
You are standing on the street [outside] of the Committee's [Headquarters], which are to the east. The central park of Freedonia is to the north.
You are standing in one of the few grassy places in Freedonia. The park is visited by a great deal of [people] daily due to the fact that it is in the exact center of the city. Roads lead in all [four] cardinal directions.
You are standing on Goldwater Lane, one of the main streets of the city. A small [pawn shop] to the south is dwarfed by the massive corporate [edifice] that looms to the north. Freedonia Park lies to the east.
Just being on this street makes you shiver in disgust. You're standing east of the [town hall], the central [seat] of the local capitalist [government]. The city center is to the south.
McCarthy Boulevard stretches through Freedonia. To the north is J. Edgar Hoover High [School] and directly across the street to the south is Rand's [Liquors]. The city center is to the west.
Considering that the last time you were here you stole a desk from the basement, that isn't very surprising. Since the [elevators] are apparently inaccessible, your only exit is to the west.
A [model train display] covers a 4' x 8' [pool table]. [Taped] to the right [corner] of the [table], a [yellow ribbon] hangs. The [lighting] is [hazy].
This is the room you awoke in. There is nothing here. [Doorways] lacking [doors] lead south and east.
This is a normal hallway, but barren. No pictures or furniture lay here, just [dust]. The wooden floors echo a tap, tap,sound as you walk down them. Whoever, or whatever, that brought you here could easily hear them.
A Victorian bathroom with a porcelain [sink], a gold trimmed [mirror], and a [bathtub]. Pleasant, actually.
An ordinary, run-of-the-mill [lecture hall]. Its [many banks of tiered [seats]] run up towards the [large and heavy double doors] at the west end. Down at floor level, at the east end of the [hall], the [professor] is teaching the lesson. Tiers upon tiers of [bored] [students] sit in the [seats].
You stand before the [pulpit], wondering if life would be worth living without [Juliet], your true love. The empty [pews] face you, as if waiting for an answer.
You stand amid carnage, [priests] killing people who watch R-rated movies!
You're dozing comfortably in a [deck chair out] on the [ice], the [dome wall] curving lazily away behind you. Somehow the distant [sun] is still warm on your face. [Jupiter] leers over the [horizon].
You're [out] on the [ice] fields in an old [rover]. In the darkness, the [headlamps] throw back blinding flashes of light from the crystalline [surface].
The red [emergency light] makes [everything] seem molten hot. [Mist] is swirling into the cabin from somewhere, making it hard to see.
The [view] onto the [water] is great, and you're looking forward to seeing the [fireworks] at midnight. You can walk towards the other end of the [roof] to the north.
You're clinging to the side of the [chimney]. From here you can go down to the rooftop or attempt to climb further up the [top] of the [chimney].
A [brick chimney] looms above you. You're at the southeast [corner] of the square [rooftop] -- the [door] you came [out] of is to the west, an overgrown [garden patch] is to the northwest. You can also go north, though there's nothing that interesting there.
To the west you can see a [nearby building], about the same height as the one you're on.
There's a great [view] of the [city] from here -- from this distance, if you squint, you can't really tell most of the buildings have been stripped and abandoned. You know that's why [Anton's] always trying to get you guys to collect up on the [rooftops], even though they've mostly been picked clean years ago -- so he can stare at his precious [Tower].
Like a lot of buildings renovated in the 1990s, it's got a small [garden patch]. Fifty years later, it's still doing its best to hide the grey concrete and metal beneath. But it comes off as a bit of a green toupee in comparison to the entirely organic, silk-lined wooden [skyscrapers] they're building today in Mumbai and Shanghai.
How do you know it's the 7th [room]? You just do.
This is where you live. It's about the only [place] in the castle where the rain doesn't get in. The [walls] are black shapes around you. To the north lies the courtyard.
Around you the [walls], or rather, what's left of them, rest silently in the darkness. Gaping [holes] mark the places where the windows used to be. To the south you can barely make out the [round tower], and only guess where the entrance lies. A black hole in one corner of the courtyard leads down and to the west, beyond the castle's gate, a [hill] slopes upward.
The [hill] looms black to the west. To the east you see the dark [walls] of the [castle]. The black surface of [Loch Awe] stretches to the southeast as far as you can see.
The country stretches dark and silent around you. To the east is the [castle and Loch Awe] lies asleep far to the southeast.
You can see are an old [altar] in one corner, which is poorly lit by some [candles], and the light square in the [ceiling], where the [stair] leads up into the courtyard. The rest is darkness.
The [lake] stretches before you. To the north, the [castle [walls]] loom above you, to the northwest the [hill] slopes upwards.
Except that it's a train [car], not a room. And the [bunks] are built into the [walls]. I think they fold up, maybe. You can't see any TV [cameras], but you know they're there. There are other [cars] to the north and south.
This [car] has little [booths] with [benches and tables] for people to eat at. It must not be mealtime, because there's no one here to serve you. There are doors to the north and south, leading to other [cars].
This cargo car is filled with [heavy iron boxes]. [Each] box is [chained] to the [walls], and most of them are [locked] tight.
It's the end of the line! That's railroad-speak. This [caboose] is just a [little] car, open to the fresh air. A railing keeps you from falling off the train. You can go back into the regular cars to the north.
You are standing in the cargo hold of your spaceship, surrounded by the powerful [machinery] which fuels your interstellar flights. An exit leads south to the control room, and an open [hatchway], showing signs of recent repair, leads northeast out onto Doom's surface.
You find yourself in the landing area by your [ship], standing  under that horrid [copper sun] of Doom. The entrance of your [ship] is to the southwest. Apart from the rather scorched area you made landing, most of what surrounds you is jungle, with narrow passages visible west, northwest, north, northeast and south. Eastwards, a vast mountain range looms, with a narrow defile tending in that direction.
You are standing at the bottom of a rocky [defile] with an exit west, and a precipitous trail climbing steeply up to the southeast to a prominent crag some way east. The ground underfoot is remarkably spongy, almost as if a giant spring lay below the surface. Indeed, your feet make faint 'Boing!' noises as you walk. The spongy area continues eastward along the [defile].
This is a richly smelling area of exotic [plants], whose heady vapours set your mind reeling. You can make out exits southwest and northwest through gaps in the ever-present jungle.
Deck Twelve You are in the heart of the administrative level of the ship, the largest level of the S.P.S. Duffy or any other Stellar Patrol ship for that matter. The corridor continues starboard and a [room] lies aft. Beyond the [door] to port lies the bulk of the Duffy. Next to the [door] is a [slot].
Cargo Bay Entrance The [deck] twelve corridor ends here at the entrance to the cargo bay, to starboard. A smaller entrance leads fore.
Cargo Bay This huge [airlock] is essentially a giant loading dock, where [truckloads of forms] arrive from various printing planets throughout the sector and are immediately distributed throughout the administrative [deck]. The only exit on foot is back the way you came. A [spacetruck], its [hatch] closed, waits in the cargo bay.
The [deck] twelve corridor ends here at the entrance to the cargo bay, to starboard.
Forms Storage [Room] This is the largest space in the ship, [three decks] tall and with the floor area of seven Rigellian buzzball fields. The only exit is fore. The [room] is filled to the [ceiling] with row upon row of [pallets] filled with [boxes]. Each box has some writing stamped on the side.
This is the largest space in the ship, [three decks] tall and with the floor area of seven Rigellian buzzball fields.
The cabin is a blur. You can't even tell how long you slept, and you're not fully awake anyway; all you can focus on is the [bathroom door] and a patch of [stars] through the [window].
The [bathroom] is small enough to give anyone claustrophobia, but the [wall]-sized [mirror] and white [furnishings] work together to improve things.
After weeks on the ship, you know this [cabin] by heart: the oddly-shaped mythyan [bed], the sitting [cushions] around the low [table] and the [generous window above] it. All round edges and soft colors. [Automatic doors] lead to the [bathroom and outside], respectively.
This platform [aft] of the ship's [lounge] commands an ample view of the [cargo deck]. Stairs lead up and down, while [two] galleries curve backwards towards [port and starboard].
The [galactic ocean] raises majestically in front of you, splashing a million drops of [light] against the [crystal arch] that is the [bridge window]. From a small [podium] against the far [wall], the [Captain's] [seat] dominates the room. On the sides, the [comm and helm consoles] patiently await their operators.
Many a times you have lingered here, digging through the [library], listening to music or just lying on a [couch] and watching the [stars] go by at warp speed. And [after] all those dinners with the captain, you still can't handle the [replicator] properly.
A short gallery runs [fore and aft], curving high [above] the ship's [cargo deck] and under an oppressingly low [ceiling]. The [four] crewman's cabins are lined up on the [port] side; one of the [doors] seems to be unlocked.
A hundred tons of cargo would not crowd this place too much, but empty as it is now, it makes you feel like you're in the belly of some metal whale. The [transporter's] [alcove] takes up one side, leaving the other to an [airlock] and its [antechamber]. A flight of stairs nonchalantly climbs to the middle deck.
About half a dozen [spacesuits] are packed in their racks along the [wall], together with other gear that might prove useful to a landing party.
At its top, the [ramp] ends in a short, wide room, compressed between [two archways]. The front one is meant to generate an [atmospheric] [force field], thus allowing the [ramp] to open up in space, or underwater.
Your safehouse is truly a feng-shui nightmare come true. Mother screamed and fainted when she first saw the thing. You prefer to think about your safehouse as a collection of objects so as not to be thrown off kilter by the [arrangement]: Your suped up [Apple iie computer] forms the centerpiece of the room. An [arrangement of cans] are stacked against the wall, forming a pyramid.
Heavy layers of smoke fill the huge [casino] floors. It's oppressive. Your [mates] are sitting at the [blackjack table] here, and the rest of the [casino] lies north. A [small door] with an [exit sign] above lies to the southwest.
It's a crisp autumn day. Around you, [leaves] of gold and orange hang on the [trees]; [Farmer Brown] and his [wife] draw [scary faces] on the [scarecrows] to the south. The road is to the east. Far off toward the northwest, a small, [oddly shaped building] sits [atop] a small [hill].
Oh, to have feet, and to feel the gravel beneath them! Happy day! As a [pumpkin]/human hybrid, your main fears are failure and empty pie crusts. The [pumpkin] patch is to the west. The [road] continues north.
Around you, [leaves] of gold and orange hang on the [trees]; you can see a [cornfield] with scarecrows to the south.
What's the most beautiful part of country living? The trees? The fields? The dead animals in the [road], which will remain lying there stinking until they decompose into oblivion? The [road] continues south. There's a school to the east.
You stand in the parking lot [behind] the high [school], near the [huge billboard] that proudly proclaims the [school's] [motto]. You think to yourself: a small-town public high [school], a full moon rising, and me an undead vegetable-brained maniac... ah, gee, hope nothing kooky happens. There's a road to the west, and the [school's] rather flimsy-looking [back door] is to the north.
There is a knock at the [door] of your office. Without waiting for an answer, the Dean of the university walks into your working quarters, followed by [three] gentlemen sharply dressed in charcoal [suits].
You are in your messy [office], where you end up spending most of your time here at the university. A dusty [window] looks out over other buildings that constitute the campus of University Boheme. To the south, your [office door] is cracked open a few inches, and you can hear the occasional footsteps of a student or faculty member as they walk to and fro in the hallway.
You are at the west end of a long, dark hallway with obtrusive shadows upon the [walls] from the students who lurk at the far end of the hall. Their presence is stifling this early in the morning when you hope to get the bulk of your day's work done. Of course, today's task is different: find a missing man. Ironically, as an academic in the nascent field of psychology, you have always considered yourself on a search for that which man is missing. Your office is to the north; the hallway stretches eastward.
The [kitchen] walls rise high [above] you. [Intricate carvings] dominate the [cupboards and appliances]. The [spirits] of your [ancestors] cry [out] to you from the [formica]. You hold back your tears. It is the time of testing. You must be a man.
Newly fallen [snow] sits gently on the roof. Nearby, you spot a [chimney] you can climb down.
Everything about this place gives you a headache: the [fluorescent] [lights] reflecting off the polished [faux-marble] [flooring], the greasy funk of the food court, the echoes of screaming [children] and Christmas music piped through tinny [speakers]. You have got to get [out] of here.
Something about the 10-foot tall [hedges] and the squishy, padded [astroturf] under your feet has transported you away from the migraine-inducing chaos of the mall. But now the narrow [pathways] and tall [hedges] make you feel antsy and claustrophobic.
You are at the [snowy] intersection of several narrow passages.
A small [army] of animatronic [elves] stands immobile amidst an array of silent toy producing [machines]. Dressed in festive [red and green aprons], clenching [mallets and bellows] and hand-[powered] [drills], they are Santa's sweatshop [workforce] (although you wonder how much sweating one does at the North Pole, and then remind [yourself] that these are animatronic [elves] who wouldn't sweat anyhow, and besides even if they could sweat they're just standing there not moving or anything at the moment).
You are at the narrow, [snowy] intersection of several passages.
You've worked your way pretty deep into the [tunnel] and it is really too dark to see anything. The opening of the [tunnel] is to the north and a bit of light filters in from the mall, but just enough for you to find your way back [out].
This was the break room for the Santaland elves (meaning: the human teenagers who worked here in Santaland during their winter breaks from school). Once, this might have been an okay place to hang [out] with your fellow slackers and talk about how lame all of this Santaland [junk] is, but now the room has been [trashed], even by teenage slacker standards.
There are [doors] to the south, the west, and the southwest.
You are in a wider, more spacious bedroom, with sunlight streaming in through the [windows]. There is a cluttered [desk] with a [Macintosh computer]. There are a number of [posters] on the [wall]. A door to the north leads to the common room.
You are inside one of the entryways in Holder, a lovely gothic dorm. In several places the [wooden] [panelling] that covers the [wall] has been punched away, revealing the ugly [concrete] surface behind it. To the northeast is the entrance to 21 Holder. A staircase leads up, and a [door] to the west leads out into the archway.
You are on the second floor landing. A [door] to the northeast leads into room 22, and stairs lead down to the first floor.
You are in the common room of 22 Holder Hall. It's just as [messy] as 21 Holder, but the [mess] seems more delicate somehow -- clearly, it has a feminine touch. [Doorways] south and west lead into the bedrooms, and you can exit the room to the southwest.
This is Lisa and Ashley's room. For the most part, it's identical to the small bedroom in 21 Holder; it is just as cramped, and just as dark. The only difference is a [dearth of posters of scantily-clad females].
This is Whitney and Melisande's room. It's one of those rooms you sometimes see in adventure [games] that was put in for the sake of completeness, but doesn't really have anything to do with the story.
West is the [wall] of the [kitchen]. Most of the [space] along the [wall] is [planted with herbs -- bay, parsley], stalks of [mint] -- left of the open [doorway]. To its right is only a [drainage] [ditch], catching the [outflow] of a [pipe] that comes through the [wall].
A long, cross-[beamed] [room], originally washed with [white], though [smoke] has tinged the [walls] above the massive [fireplace] in which roasts are prepared. In addition, there are [thick high tables] that run the length of the [room].
Up here the female [servants] used to sleep. Now there is only a dreary row of unmade [beds]; a [rack] for [drying washing]; the [fireplace], hollow and untended. Time was, when you were very young, that you used to creep in here for chatter and gossip, and the language you were used to hearing at home.
A narrow [corridor] between the [kitchen] and the main house, which has a thick separate [wall]. The two buildings are only barely attached, to discourage fires. A small staircase leads down.
A small, workmanlike [room] with a floor of [white stones]. The principal features of the [room] are a [counter], with a [large] inset [washbasin] also made of [stone], and a [tall wooden cupboard].
This spacious [room] serves as your [bedroom], your hospital, your jail. Your enormous, elaborate [bed] occupies the bulk of the space here. Next to the [bed] is an array of [medical devices], several are which are plugged directly into your body. Also next to the [bed] is a [nightstand]. Hanging on the [eastern] wall is an ornate [tapestry], and the northern wall is dominated by a [window] from which you could see your garden, if it weren't dark [outside]. Suspended from the [ceiling] is a metal [rack] holding several [monitors], your links to the [outside] world. To the south is a doorway to the [hallway].
This pleasant, [grassy] [quadrangle] is shaded by magnificent [trees]. Peaceful, almost cloistered, it eases your nervous excitement with a sense of serenity and high purpose. It is [everything] you had imagined the [campus] of a renowned institution of higher learning would be.
The spacious lobby is [paneled] in fine [walnut]. [Portraits] of stuffy looking, dead white [males] seem to sneer at you. Heavy [carpets] cushion your hesitant footsteps.
This part of the campus is parched [earth] and browning [weeds]. The [classrooms] are north, a ragged [line of surplus Quonset huts] and converted [chicken coops]. Massive [stone ruins] that would not look out of place in Transylvania brood to the south; a [dark opening] enters the small portion still standing. The [barren yard] ends a few hundred feet to the east, closed off by a [high iron fence]. To the west is the back of the elegant [administration] [building] and its patch of fine [lawn]. A [path] southwest leads to the quadrangle.
Dim light from small, [grimy windows] reveals a [filthy] room filled with [familiar, dangerous] looking [equipment]. In the center of the room is a [massive wooden table], heavily [scarred] and ominously [stained]. Next to the [table] is the [shellerator]. [Shelves] for created objects sit in a back corner of the room.
This [bedroom] is a medium-sized [room], with an ugly flower [wallpaper]. A [dresser] sits in an [awkward corner]. An [entrance] to a small bathroom is to the west while the [door] to the main [corridor] to the east. A [cheap window] sits at one side. A [trapdoor] in the [ceiling] seems to lead up to an [attic], although high up.
This is a bare-bones two-piece bathroom. The [wall] is [painted] [blue]. A [pendant] hangs from the [ceiling], with a [switch] to turn it on on the [wall].
You are in a cubic room, about four meters to the side. The four [walls], [ceiling], and floor are [each white]. There are doorways to the east, south, west, and north.
The early morning light falls through the [window] and illuminates the chaotic state of the [room], with [clothes, bottles and glasses] spread [out] on the floor, [side table], TV and [shelves]. A turned-over [plant pot] has spread [soil] onto the [sofa], and the [carpet] has a [big red stain]. A hall lies north.
You are standing in a dark [hall] with exits west to the kitchen, and east to a bedroom. The [room] opens to the living [room] to the south, and the [apartment door] lies to the north.
The [kitchen] looks like something from a model catalogue, modern and elegant with white [tiling] and new [kitchenware]. A small dining [table] with matching [chairs] sits by the [window].
The [bedroom] is painted in soft blue colours, and contains a [wide bed] and a [wardrobe].
You are at the foot of Mr. Field's driveway (which continues to the west). The magnificent [oak tree] of your youth, clad in crimson, [branches] reaching eternally, stands here.
Bright spotlights blaze on you, making you sweat and distracting you from the vital decisions you must make. Behind you, brightly colored [neon] frames the [four doors] behind which lurk dangers unknown or prizes beyond belief.
Few pedestrians walk the streets today, probably due to the incessant [drizzling rain]. The street leads [both] east and west. To the east is an intersection with another road, and back to the west is the [airport] you arrived at. On the north side of the street is a [shop] called "El [Fin] de [los Dias]".
In every direction you see [socks]. There are [hundreds] of them -- nay, [thousands]. The [shelves] are filled with them. A [saleslady] is standing behind the [counter], watching you carefully.
There's a non-[descript building] to the north. The road continues west toward the sock shop, and to the north -- although it appears a [construction] [crew] is blocking off the way to the north.
The courtyard, empty but for your lonesome self, stretches on and on to the north and south. A [high chain-link] [fence] marks the eastern boundry, broken directly to the east by a large, [wide-open] [gate]. The [sun] beats down from [high] in the sky, and the only shade is from a tiny building to the west. [High] above you, [vultures] circle and croak at each other.
This [room] reminds you of a [Victorian study]: it is roughly square and all the exposed [walls] are [panelled] [with dark oak], up to a height of about [six] feet, [with bare] cream [plaster above]. In the centre of the [room] is an [old mahogany desk, with] a [leather chair] behind it. Beyond the [desk] is a [stone fireplace, with] a [framed] [painting above] it. One of the side [walls] is completely taken up [with] a [book case], most of which is closed [with glass doors]. On the opposite wall, [above] a [wooden] [table], is the only [window], and sole source of light in this rather gloomy [room]. In the [fourth] wall is the [single door]. There is a clutter of miscellaneous items everywhere, and in the [four corners] of the [room], you can see a [hatstand], an [antique globe], a [wooden] [corner shelf] and a [low cupboard].
You stand (here), bathed in the (flickering (deathlike)) glow of the (useless) control panels. No one (human) is left in the building besides yourself (you think). To the (downhill) north, you can see a [door] leading to the (research (horror!)) [laboratories], and to the (upstairs) south you see more offices.
The (chief administrator's) office. A ([large] ([heavy])) [desk] sits in the middle. On the (([bare]) [white]) [wall] hangs a [photograph]. You may return (downhill) north to the control room.
It's kind of boring here. I hear the king hasn't put anybody in the dungeon in over a year. Must make you feel special. It's drafty, being up in the tower, and the stones in the wall have chips and various--- do you really care? They're old. The [door] looks pretty sturdy. There's some light coming into the room from a [window] about, uh, twice your height up. Can we leave?
You are standing just south of the [Castle Shadowgate]. In front of you, to the north, is a [heavy wooden door] set in the stone [wall] of the [castle]. A [skull] hangs over the [door].
You stand in a long corridor. [Huge stone archways] line the entire [hall]. At the north end of this room is an impressive [hall door] covered with sheets of [steel]. A [small door] is to the east.
You survey your one small [room]. One [desk], paper-piled, with a dusty computer shoved to the side. Your [futon], upon which you sit. Second-hand [stereo] sitting on a [cardboard crate]. A kitchen [nook] one way and a bathroom [nook] the other, with a closet to the side. A broad mirror tries to make the place seem twice its size; it halfway works. One [window], whose [shade] is down, and the front [door] firmly shut.
Your [futon].
Your eyes take a moment to get used to the darkness that surrounds you, but you eventually manage to peer into the thick ink that presses in around you. There's a small dusty [wooden] area that serves as a floor, surrounded by dense black nothingness. Cluttered objects litter the floor, some falling apart, including a huge chipped marble [head] and a silent [Grandfather] [clock].
A [black forbidding] [gate] looms between yourself and the gravel [drive] going up to an old [eerie house] set on a hill to the north. Light from the [full moon] casts strange [shadows] behind you and the [dark forest] engulfing this area. The [road] you came from is west.
The playground is a fun place for [kids] to spend their recess. There's a [swingset] here, made of candycanes and licorice. The school is south.
Nannies often bring their [children] here to this London park. With entrances from [both] Kensington and Notting Hill, the park reflects the posh neighborhood and residents. An army of workmen maintain the manicured lawns and the large leafy trees that line the pathways. You catch a glimpse of the Round Pond to the south. An [ornate gate] to a [children's] playground is to the east.
Two small [fountains] gurgle [water] in a circle around a larger fountain. There are statues of [mermaids] in various poses arranged around the middle fountain. A [slide] begins behind the [fountains] and winds around to end in front. The straw tips of the wigwams are visible to the north and the stern of a ship to the northeast. A path east leads to small log cabin surrounded by benches.
Three [tipis] stand here around fireplace made by a ring of stones and sticks. The [tipis] on the side are closed. The [tipi] in the middle is the only one with a small flap that is open, to allow entry inside. You can just make out the tip of a ship to your east, and a small fountain to the south.
Pebbles and sand are scattered together to resemble a pebbly beach. A full [replica] of a [pirate ship] stands here, with anchor weighed and a Jolly Roger flapping merrily in the breeze. The gangplank is down for easy boarding of the [ship]. A treehouse is visible to the north and a log cabin to the south. You can see the top of the tipis to your west and a fountain to the southwest.
Picnic tables and benches are arranged in careful rows in front of a a [small] log [cabin]. [Nanny Jenny] is sitting on the bench, reading a book. You can see the fountains to the west and a replica of a ship to the north.
This is the deck of the Ship of Whimsy. It is spacious, indeed vast, maple timbers firm beneath your feet. To the [aft] is the [aftcastle], and above it (upward from here) is the poop deck. To [port], or down, is the gangplank, the only breach in the brass railings lining the deck's edges. On the [starboard] side you can see several [coracles] lashed to the hull.
This is the [aftcastle], a dim cabin at the stern of the Ship.
This is the gangplank. Its brass-bound oak planks slant up [starboard]-ways to the ship, and down-or [port]-to the dock.
This is the poop deck. Golden railings fence off this raised platform; you can see most of the Ship from here. An elaborate [compass] is mounted to the deck. From here you can climb down to return to the main deck.
Everything has its less dignified parts. There are toilets to be scrubbed, linens to be laundered -- and down in the basement [pantry], there is room-[service] to be prepared and delivered.
The floor is not perfectly clean, and the [brass fixtures] not perfectly polished, but at least it works. An [advertisement] [for] the hotel's spa is fixed to the [wall], in an attempt to attract custom.
Not quite your standard [kitchen]. No cabinet. No sink. No stove, or oven, or drawer. Instead you see an empty room, in the centre of which is a [gleaming machine].
Calling your living quarters modest would be an insult to modesty. Sometimes when looking at your [bare] room and tiny [bed] you wonder about your choice to set up in London as a tradesman, but then the excitement of the scene in which you move reminds you that financial prosperity is not everything. Other than the [bed] the room contains only the [bare necessities] of living. To the east is your workroom.
Your modest place of [business] is dominated by your [printing press], a large contraption of wood, metal, and [stone] standing in a place of honor at the center of the room. Surrounding it are its attendants: a [drying rack], a few large [boxes of movable type], several [stacks of blank paper, buckets of ink and water] with [ink balls] standing beside, and a simple work-[table]. Between the encroaching Plague and the typical bleak London winter most readers have abandoned the city for more hospitable climes. There is therefore little [business] for your trade right now, but all stands ready in hopeful anticipation. Your tiny bedroom lies to the west, the [door] to the street to the north.
You stand near the [Thames] in Blackfriars, just north of your modest [printworks]. The narrow street, running east toward London Bridge and west in parallel with the [river], is somewhat [crowded] but perhaps a bit quieter than usual, and most of the surrounding [buildings] are shut up tight. A small but nevertheless disturbing number of their [doorways] are marked with crudely painted [red crosses].
You stand before the only [bridge] across the [Thames], which seems to fairly bend in the middle under the sheer mass of [humanity] that throngs upon it.
You stand on London [Bridge] amidst the densest collection of [humanity] to be found anywhere in England. You get no more than an occasional glimpse of the [Thames] through gaps in the [shops crowding] either side of the narrow roadway. The [buildings] rise far above your head, and are often connected at their tops by [bridged] [walkways]. The overall effect is more akin to passing through a tunnel than crossing a [bridge]. And then there are the [people crowding] the road as well as every nook and crevice off it, and making forward motion an exercise in patient near-futility.
The southern end of London [Bridge] is dominated by a massive [gatehouse]. Impaled upon the [spikes] of the open [gate] are the [severed heads] of criminals, a [spectacle] to which the populace barely spares a glance. To the east stands the almost equally grim facade of [Marshalsea] [Prison], while Stoney Street parallels the [riverbank] to the west.
You stand atop the kitchen bench, surveying what was once a happy home, but now seems full of terror. Your family [toaster] stands before you, chrome faintly glimmering through years of baked on grime. A precipitous drop to the south overshadows the hard, tiled floor. To the east lies the [sink], with its unwashed [dishes] appearing more menacing by the moment. Beyond the [sink] you can see the [phone] - perhaps your only chance to seek help.
You can see a [dresser] and a [vanity] here.
You stand at the bottom of a steep [hill] that slopes upwards.
Count Ruggino's [house] lours in the dim air like a gathering of gravestones. The road makes a circle before it, then runs north back to Firenze.
Your office is clean and tidy, just the way you like it. Fastened to your [desk] is a name-plate, which reads "Agent Socks Molder, Paranormal Investigation." The main room of the Police Station is to the east.
The bubble-cockpit is as cold, sterile, and boring as ever. The view of the [stars] is less overwhelming than it used to be: now they're mostly just boring to look at. You check your [console] one last time. [Everything's] set, you can wake up your replacement whenever you want to.
As with [everything] else onboard, the sick bay is underwhelming. It's a small room with a med-bed and a bulky set of scanners and robotic arms. Going under the knife here would be truly unpleasant.
You hear the drone of [bees]. They don't scare you as much as they used to. One stung you, and it wasn't the end of the world. You learned to stand still without freezing up, but when you said there was a deeper lesson, someone laughed at you. You wonder now how you could've held your ground a bit better, or if you'll get the chance again.
This looks like the sort of place where couples go to make [out]. Big grown-up high school couples, you once [thought]. But you're in college now and know they usually embellished the fun times here.
There's not much here in [Cadet Space], just a [cots] [mass]. Well, there's a [pocket] sewn into the east [wall].
A [massive cedar desk, well-polished and worn], looks elegantly out-of-place among the chaos. [Papers, files, and books] cover nearly every flat surface in the room.
The [walls] and floor are a clinical [white tile and marble]. However, the [dim lights set] above this echoing space hiss and pop fitfully, giving the small maze of [desks and workspaces] within a tarnished, decaying look.
This [walled] off area sits at the bottom of a massive [staircase] which leads into the building to the north. At its base is a [sign] reading "[Bethlehem Hospital] - Administration." The [outer walls] meet here - meeting at the distant [gates] which sit to the southeast.
This room is mostly empty space. The farthest [wall] is lined with gleaming, [brass pull-file] [drawers] and seems to go on infinitely in every direction. The entrance to the west opens onto a solid, [dusty] [platform], which allows visitors to stand suspended above the unseen floor.
The slight wind whistles tunelessly against this [mesh of steel], which arcs from one [massive, opened gate] to another. A [roof] curves far overhead, enclosing [both] the block-like building to the east and the [narrow tower] to the west. Far below, an intricate set of sub-[buildings] can be seen, enclosed within the complex's [outer wall].
Snow is all around you, reducing [everything] in sight to a vast, [white], featureless [plain]. You'd hardly be able to tell one direction from another were it not for the [sun] rapidly [sinking] towards the western [horizon], and the [mountains] up ahead to the north. Unless you're much mistaken, those [mountains] mark the end of your quest, but you won't reach them tonight. Indeed, if you don't find shelter soon, you'll probably freeze.
The [track] is knee-[deep] in [snow]. To the south the [ground] descends gently back towards the plain, while to the north it meanders towards the [distant mountain]. Just to the west is the [mouth] of a [cave] where you could take shelter for the night. Some distance above the [mouth] of the [cave] a [small, leafless tree] clings to the [barren hillside].
The [cave] is irregular in shape, as if scooped [out] of the [rock] by a mad giant in a fit of rage. The [rear] of the [cave] is broad, with a [crooked cranny] leading off to the northwest, but it's much narrower at the east end, just by the exit. The centre of the [cave] is fairly spacious, and is at least dry and sheltered from the wind, and there are plenty of places where the [ground] isn't too rough.
This [small nook] is formed by a short jagged passage running from the rear of the [cave], coming to an end where the [nook wall] closes in. There's quite a musty smell but [barely] enough light to see by here, so to find anything you'd need to feel your way, but you can just see that the main part of the [cave] lies to the southeast.
A row of [suites] runs north-south between the tavern and the south wing. It's dilapidated and heavily boarded up, much like the rest of the surroundings.
This is the office of Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, the only detective agency which solves the whole [problem], relying on the interconnectedness of all things. Your [desk and file cabinet] are here, but sitting on the waiting area's sofa is fairly uncomfortable since the sofa is currently stuck in the stairwell off the hall to the west.
This is the hallway outside your Holistic Detective Agency. There's a nice brass plaque by your open [doorway] to the east. On the opposite side is an [unmarked door]. Stairs lead down.
This is a poorly-built stairwell, with protruding beams and cornices here and there and everywhere. Only the southern [wall] is [plain].
If nothing else, you have a good [seat]. The [stage] is only a few rows to the north. [People] are jammed on [benches] in every direction; you think the [aisle] is somewhere to the west.
If nothing else, you had a good [seat].
You are surrounded by empty [benches]; the [aisle] is somewhere to the west.
You are adrift in a sea of empty [benches]. The [aisle] is nearby, west, and your [seat] is far in to the east.
The [aisle] is almost roomy now that everyone is gone. It extends north and south. Your [seat] is somewhere deep in the [benches] to the east.
You're halfway up the [aisle] on the west side of the theater. [Everything] is dim.
You're at the top of the [aisle]; the theater stretches away to the north and east, echoing dark. Everything east is a solid mass of [benches], of course. Wide [doors] to the south lead outside.
People flock here, in the shade of the colonaded [portico], talking and drinking [sharp beer]. The main entrance to the [theater] is back north; the [street] runs bright and dusty to the south, and the [crowded] [portico] continues to the west.
More [people] are relaxing here, perhaps because of the [kegman] who sells his [beer] under the [theater portico]. The main [street] bakes in [sunlight] to the south; the front of the [theater] continues to the north, adorned by some decorative [potted shrubs].
This is your room, where you've have [some] of your most cherished moments. It's been just about [half] a year since the start of classes, [but] even in that [short] period, you've made many memories. Mornings are the most pleasant here, sunlight shines through the [windows], casting the room in the golden hue of the dawn. Your [desk] is decorated with [pictures, pencils, snacks, and books]. The [walls] are sparse, mostly white, no posters or anything, you prefer it neat. Almost [everything] is ordered, and not a thing is usually [out] of place. Your [bed] is in one [corner] of the room. The [windows] are dark, it's [night] time [out].
His face is warm, kind, and genuine. That's what you liked about [him], his realness. Always, when you were around [him], you felt real. Truth is what attracted you to [him].
Flashing, multihued lights and a throbbing sound system bring life to this otherwise barren establishment. A few people seem to be clustered around the bar to the east and the tables to the west; it doesn't look like anyone's paying attention to the [race]. A cold draft is coming from the entrance to the south.
Unlike the rest of the house, this [room] seems untouched for the most part. The [dresser and vanity] are covered in [dust]; their [drawers] haven't been yanked [out] and tossed around the [room]. The [door] to the east is closed. The [windows] to the west are smashed, but the [curtains] are still hanging. It looks like the only thing that's been disturbed is the [bed], and we know who to blame for that.
The bridge is dominated by a [wide window] looking out to the open [vista of space]. [Consoles] of various sorts are scattered across the room, and a [large door] provides egress from the room.
You are on an [iceburg], floating somewhere off the coast of Nova Scotia. Water stretches in all directions, except to the west, where land is a stones throw away.
This is an abandoned [amusement park]. None of the normal structures are left save for a tall wooden roller-coaster. The beach can be seen to the south and the coaster platform can be seen to the west.
You are in the roller coaster car. The car pulls out of the [platform], turns sharply to the right, then begins the climb to the [top]....
The [beach] is wider here, with wind-swept dunes. One of the dunes seems to beckon to the southwest. The [beach] narrows, but flattens to the north.
You are standing atop the tallest [dune] for as far as the [eye] (the only one you have) can see. To the north can be seen an abandoned amusement park with a tall wooden roller-coaster, and to the south is desolate scrub and [sand].
The car slowly reaches the [top]....
You are in the cramped one-man Class Eight [Space] Scooter, with a [couch] for the [pilot]. Through the [viewport], you see a rapidly approaching [Space] Station. Below the [viewport] is a [slot]. The [scooter's] [metre square steel hatch] which governs life and death (in [space], anyway) is currently closed.
Through the [viewport], you see the docking [port] of the [Space] Station BG-12.
The [scooter's] [metre square steel hatch] which governs life and death (in [space], anyway) is currently open.
This is the huge docking [port] of the space station. Only one [ship] is here at the moment, a one-man [scooter], so the docking [port] seems unusually empty. A [tube] leads down toward the heart of the station.
This is the station's main corridor, which continues to [port and starboard]. You detect a slight upward curve in the corridor. A [tube] leads up toward the docking [port].
[Rooms] lie [fore and aft].
This is the station's main corridor, which continues to [starboard]; to [port] is an [habitation] [bulkhead].
The [habitation] [bulkhead] is closed. Stencilled on the [bulkhead] in bright [yellow letters] are the words "To [Habitation] Arc".
Most of the equipment here is too complicated for anyone without molecular [transport] training to use. However, the [red button] of the [teleporter] [control panel] is well-marked. There is also a [transporter] [pad] here.
This appears to be a map [room], with a [holographic] map on [each] free [wall]. The [maps] are of this [space station], a [planetary] [colony], and a [space] '[elevator']. The only exit is [aft]. (Footnote 1)
This is the Station Manager's [conference] [room]. There are a large [conference] [table] and about a dozen [chairs] here. On one [wall] is a [photograph].
This is the nerve center of the space station, where every system can be [monitored]. Several [monitors] are [blinking] amber.
This is the [office] of the station manager. It is simply furnished, with a [file cabinet] and a [desk]. There's an [electrical] [outlet] on one [wall].
You are in the cramped one-man space scooter. The [controls] seem to consist of a solitary [green button].
The [scooter's] [hatch] is closed.
The [scooter's] [hatch] is open.
Room lie [fore and aft].
Your [bedroom] is quite modest for someone of nobility; still it's likely the largest in Hinter [Keep]. The main furnishings here--a [bed], a [desk], an [armoire] and a [fireplace]--are all of deceptive quality. Plain on first glance, they gradually reveal their exquisite workmanship. An [opened] [bay window] offers a view of most of the [keep] and, for the moment at least, a warm, spring breeze.
You are standing in the center of a colorwheel, its hues sliding away from your perception on all sides. Several dark gray [statues] in varying states of disrepair stand nearby.
Before you stands the awe-imposing facade of the Barrel of [Monkeys] Funhouse. You've been through it millions of times -- they had to close the barrel down ages ago due to a lawsuit, and the only [monkey] left is the mannequin above the ride's entrance. Today it appears as if the funhouse is closed, adding yet another layer of depressing crap to the already large mountain of crap that is the rundown Seaside Amusement Park.
Nothing quite beats being in the great [outdoors].
A dull beige affair, cluttered with [crumbling cardboard boxes and unimportant]-looking [papers]. There is a PA [speaker] on the [wall].
The hallway ends in a northerly dead-end here. On the [wall] there is a gigantic "14", presumably the floor number. The corridor continues to the south. There is a massive hole in the [ceiling], through which the [ceiling] of the floor above is visible.
The great assembly floor of '[Rockets], Sprockets, and [Pants],' which stretches in every direction as far as the eye can see. Particularly to the north, where some of your buddies with the propulsion labs work.
Council [Chamber] You are in the Council [Chamber] of the ancient Guild [Hall] at [Borphee].
[Sneffle] is addressing the meeting.
[Hoobly] is addressing the meeting.
[Gzornenplatz] is addressing the meeting.
Scurrying wetly hither and yon around you are [many] brightly colored [newts], [efts, and salamanders]. [Toads and frogs] hop excitedly about.
Belwit Square This is Belwit Square. To the north is the ancient Guild [Hall]. A wide cobblestone street runs east and west. To the south is the storied [Manse], home of the Mayors of Borphee for generations.
You are barely able to keep your [eyes] open.
You are in a tall passageway enclosed by [rock walls] that extend upward [out] of sight. The [walls] are adorned with several [torches]; they are providing ample illumination. To the south, the passageway opens into a wider area. The floor at the north end of the passageway contains a [circular hole] that is approximately 4' in diameter.
You are in the southeastern portion of a dimly-lit cavern. Twenty feet above you is a [circular opening], approximately 4' in diameter. To the south and east are [twenty-foot] tall [rock walls]. To the north and west, it is pitch black.
To the east, the wooden stairs lead up to the grueful darkness of the forgotten attic. The dark [hallway] leads away to the west, back towards the comparative civilisation of the lower floors. [Torches] line the walls on [both] sides of the [passage].
The dark [hallway] continues from east to west. The walls are adorned with [flaming torches].
You look around again. The [carriage] is small and is practically empty. On the floor in front of you is a sea of [dead wasps] - there's not a live one to be found. You look over at your only living [companion], tied up and leaning against the [wall opposite] you. Your eyes meet, and you try to convey sympathy, and you try to read sympathy from his, but that wouldn't do either of you any good even if you could hide the fear. The [light flickers] off for a second, sending you temporarily into [darkness].
You're only aware of a mild [tingling] in your [fingertips].
Your throat feels dry and scratchy, and your feet feel like they're [light]-years away.
The inside of Cryotube 451 is still bitter cold, a side effect of decades of deep space travel and [cryogenic] hibernation. Given the harsh temperatures required for cryosleep, the name of your particular tube seems a cruel irony. Still, it is entirely identical to the other [four]-hundred and nintey-[nine] chambers on this ship, with a comfortable [cryogenic cradle], some stasis [monitoring] [equipment], and a blinking wall-[mounted display panel] next to a small [red lever].
It's midnight. There's blood everywhere because, hot diggety ding-dong damn, you just murdered someone with a plastic [spork] for trying to destroy the Universe. I mean, congratulations and all, but seriously, that's just...weird, man.The [corpse] of the man you most royally ensporked for trying to destroy the Universe with only his pinkie finger (he can do that, you know) is lying in front of you on the floor of the derelict, teal, horrible-smelling men's room. There's an entrance to the hallway of the abandoned community center that you're in to the South.
A stark circular [spotlight] high above you shines on a polished [marble] floor. The [darkness] outside the [spotlight] is total.
Before you, to the north, stands Morkenmindan's Mediocre [Manor].
First impressions are very important, so foyers are often the grandest rooms in a [building]. If this is the most impressive room in the [manor], then you've got a long, long day ahead of you. Open archways stand to the north, west, and east.
The kitchen is monumentally filthy. You look for some [place] to start -- a grubby teacup to pour down the sink, perhaps -- but give up in despair. An archway to the south affords you an escape from the stench. There's also a [door] to a [pantry] or something, to the east.
This smallish room is filled by a [staircase] which leads up to... well, nowhere, actually. Its only purpose is to entrap intruders, which it seems to have done with lethal efficiency. They must have entered from the east.
You stand in the middle of a [grove of aspen], which extends in all directions. Slender [white trunks] reach for the [sky] with long thin fingers, stroking the [clouds] that blow in the autumn [breeze]. [Leaves of gold] rattle as the [winds] shift, and here and there one floats to the ground to join others that crackle underfoot when you move. A narrow [path] disappears east into the [trees], and a camping area is visible through a small opening to the west. North is a wide meadow.
Remote and secluded, this is the perfect spot for a campsite. The [ground] is flat and slightly higher in the [middle] of the [opening]. A small two-[person tent] rests comfortably on a [bed of leaves] between a [pair] of the [biggest] [trees]. You can see a [meadow] to the north and a [path] leads east. A [large bull elk] and his [harem] sit in the [shade] in front of the [tent].
The [stream] becomes treacherous further downstream to the west, the [rapids] there splashing [white water] with a roar. The way north leads into the [forest].
You are at the north edge of the large and [grassy] [meadow], bordered by [aspen]. [Fireweed] grows at the base of the [trees, pink blooms] withered and gone to [seed].
You are at the west edge of a large [grassy] [meadow]. To the south is your [campsite].
The east end of the [meadow] is [rocky], and you make your way carefully when you move. Farther east, a [granite cliff] blocks your way. The remnants of an old mountain trail lead northeast.
You are in the middle of a slowly moving mountain [stream]. The [water] is [colder] than you had hoped, and is quickly numbing your bare feet and ankles. [Rocks] cover the bottom of the [stream], and the easiest way out is north.
You are at the north [edge] of an enticing mountain [stream]. The sound of the [water] flowing over rounded [stones] is enough to bring relaxation to even the weariest of travelers. Good thing, too, as your sore muscles scream from bouncing over too many rough roads. The only obvious trail leaves north.
This is [Sparky and Boots'] [play room]. It contains fun things that they can use. There is also a [cold, gray door] to the north and an open [doorway] to the east.
This [room] is where Boots and Sparky pursue more mundane activities such as [drinking] and sleeping. A [cabinet] is mounted on the north [wall], and a [water bowl] is affixed to the floor. A [doorway] back to the play [room] lies to the west.
You're in your apartment. The front [door] lies west.
This is the north end of the hallway. Since June is the stinky lady that lives down the hall, and since this is down the hall, therefore [June's] apartment must be here. And so it is, Q.E.D. The front [door] to [June's] apartment is east. It appears to be open.
The apartment of [stinky] landlady June looks pretty much like you'd expect. [Everything] looks either old, handmade, gaudy, or a combination of all three. And it all stinks. Go figure. The only surprise here is that [stinky] June has a [giant stinky computer] in her [stinky] apartment, between the [stinky cat food dish] and the [stinky cat litterbox].
Afternoon light pours in along with a bitter Autumn breeze through the cracks between the [graying] [two]-by-[fours] shoddily assembled to create this dilapitated tool [shed]. It serves as a rendezvous point for your neighborhood [tribe of gray squirrels]. The [door] to the [shed] hangs open to the south.
Sprouting from a [small dirt circle] in the center of the yard is The [Youthful Oak], which grows in your territory and belongs to your tribe. The rendezvous point can be entered to the north while a [textured stone trail] winds off to the west. There is also room to scurry around to the south. A [smooth metal post] rises up from a [mound] of decaying [sunflower seed] shells here.
Beyond the [street] to the south lies the red squirrel territory. The [street] is a main artery for [traffic] in the suburb, and the younger squirrels in your tribe are forbidden to travel even this close to it for reasons of safety. The Sterzinskis' yard lies to the north.
When there was food, and the other squirrels in your tribe had energy, games of tag would be played in this garden. You can almost hear the chirping as you would frantically hop from [sculpture] to [sculpture] in hot pursuit. A [tall stocking-capped ceramic gnome] looms rather cozily by a [birdbath]. The [sculpture] garden may be exited to the east.
A [small] hallway, brightly lit by a row of Alien Tech(tm) powered neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead upwards, and a [doorframe] opens east into the Living Room. A [small door] under the stairs lead into a storage [closet]. (Referred to by Paul only as "The Potter Room".)
Shelves are nailed to the leaning wall. On them, some useless [tools] gather dust.
Before the party [people] invaded it, this was a spacious, cozy room. Now, you have to wade through thick smoke to escape either westwards to the hallway or to the Kitchen and the Pool beyond to the South.
The main feature of this room is the impressive glass door, which leads south, to the pool. All [benches and counters] are weighted down with random [food] stuff, brought by the party goers. Of course, there are more [people] here than in the living room.
Pauls Parents are rather fond of this small [pool]. It's surrounded by some deck-chairs. The eastern and western garden [walls] are overgrown with [undergrowth], so as to hide the family members going for a seamelss tan. This wasn't necessary for the southern [wall], wich is quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Pauls told you they find the occasional golf ball in the [pool] nonetheless.)
You are standing just [outside] of your [house], situated in the outskirts of the town. Near the [mailbox] crudely attached to an [iron pole] the [path] splits into [two]: one runs to the north, and the other to the east, where your garage is situated.
You're standing [outside] of your [garage], a small [brick building] with [heavy iron door]. The path runs back to the west, and the driveway leads north.
When you [opened] your eyes you weren't surprised at all to find [yourself] in a small featureless cell [with] no obvious [exits]. But there must be a way to get [out] somehow. At least you aren't going to sit there and wait until THEY come...
A [small room] without any exits. You are here, staring at the [gray [walls]]. The only furniture is a [big round table] (but no chair), and a [small cabinet] in the corner.
You are in the cramped, sticky, smelly, and oppressively humid pilot's compartment of your borrowed [spaceship]. The [walls], floor, and ceiling of the [chamber] are made of [rubbery gray tubelike structures], interrupted only by the [airlock] [door] to your east. There is a [seat], of sorts, but it's broad, low, awkward, and even more suspiciously damp than the rest of the compartment. In front of it are the [Gloss] equivalent of [instruments]. Above the [instrument] panel a translucent [window] looks [out] on [outer] [space].
The Gloss ship's [airlock] is barely wide enough for you to fit into without touching the [walls] (something that's generally a good idea where Gloss technology is concerned.)
Living Quarters (You are in the [bunk].) This cubicle is your rather spartan living quarters, containing only a [bunk] and a [bureau]. The only exit is to starboard. There is a tape [library] here. (outside the [bunk]) The [alarm bell] on the mass detector is ringing stridently.
(You are in the [bunk].)
Living Quarters This cubicle is your rather spartan living quarters, containing only a [bunk] and a [bureau].
The [alarm bell] on the mass detector is ringing stridently.
Bridge This is the [control] room of the [Starcross]. There are exits labelled (arbitrarily) "Port," "Starboard," and "Out." The latter exit has a heavy [bulkhead] which is closed. Your [ship's] [computer] takes care of all the routine tasks of navigation and life support. A [control] [couch] is in the front end of the room, surrounded by [controls] and fronting a large [viewport]. The [ship's] [registration] is affixed nearby. Your mass [detector], essential in the search for black holes, sits to one side. On the [detector] are a red [button], a blue [button], and a small [screen] on which something is displayed.
This is the [control] room of the [Starcross].
Storage This cubicle is used for storage. The only exit is to port. Hanging on the rack is your space [suit]. A safety [line] hangs on the [wall].
This nook is your spartan living quarters, containing only a [bunk] and a [bureau].
Living Quarters This nook is your spartan living quarters, containing only a [bunk] and a [bureau].
An expressionless but nonetheless surly voice issues from the computer: "Please turn that [alarm] off! We'll both have headaches if you don't."
Your [ship's] [computer] does the routine tasks of navigation and life support. A [control] [couch] is mounted before a [control] [panel] and a large [viewport].
Taped to the [wall] near the [computer] is a slightly faded [instruction] [sheet] for the [computer].
Hanging on a rack is your space [suit].
The control room of your space ship, the Harbinger One. This is a large, circular room, relatively bare with featureless pale grey metal walls. Three [chairs] sit clustered together in the center of the room. There is a 7 foot tall [view screen] on the front wall of the room (showing what is [outside] of the ship). There is a pair of double sliding doors in the [aft] of the room, and there is a single sliding door in the wall to the [starboard] side of the room. The room is lit only by red emergency lighting.
This is your office space. On the wall is a [photo viewer screen]. Next to the [screen] is a [small shelf] containing various [trophies and momentos] from your journies through space. There is a weathered wooden [desk] here. On the [desk] sits an [Edible Food Molecular Assembulator] ([EFMA]).
A narrow, secluded spot in which [Klaus] is fond of reading. The ground is covered by beds of [lacegrass]. The [sky] is a crescent of deep blue above interlocking [squirrel puzzle trees]. Archways under bowed trunks open north and east.
A [sunny] green bank. Paths leads north, northwest, and west to the hidden lawn.
The hummocky ground is shaded by large [fruit trees]. Paths leads south to the greenhouse, west, and northeast.
Patterns of green and gold play around a structure of [mossy] [stones] built to look like a ruined [temple]. Its [walls] are overgrown with creeping [diamondbane]. Paths lead east to the orchard, south to the hidden lawn, and southeast to the greenhouse.
The red brick [wall] which bounds the northeast corner of the garden is broken here by a [wrought-iron gate]. The [bricks] are overgrown with [mime's-mouth]. A path leads southwest, to the orchard.
You have a nice comfy [bed] here, but you aren't in it at the moment.
There seems to be some kind of commotion [out] on the waterfront by your house. A group of [hooded, robed figures] is standing near the pier, chanting.
Warm [wind] sweeps [trash] along the black [street]. [Neon light] paints itself on the [smog, flashes] of green and pink reflected in the low, suffocating [sky]. Your [hydrobike] leans against the curb. A [parking meter] is nearby. The Red Sun [Saloon] is across the [street], just east.
This huge [airlock] is essentially a giant loading dock, where [truckloads of forms] arrive from various printing planets throughout the sector and are immediately distributed throughout the administrative [deck].
[Robot] Pool This is where a Lieutenant First Class would come to obtain a [robot] for use on an important assignment. Also for a trivial assignment like yours. The only part of the complex [robot] authorization [equipment] that is visible to you is a [slot] (for inserting your [form]) and a [keypad] (for typing your selection). You can exit aft. In the first [bin] is a bulky [robot], obviously intended for heavy lifting. A brass plate on one of his pneumatic arm lifts says "[Rex]." [Bin number two] holds a spindly little [robot], a specialized model designed for bursting and decollating multi-part [forms]. A tiny nameplate on her perforating extension reads "[Helen]." You can't see the [robot] in the third [bin] very well, because he's crouched in the corner. He's a short [robot], and he seems to be playing marbles. The third [robot] looks up from his marbles, jumps to his feet, and starts waving wildly. It's [Floyd], your [robotic] companion from Resida! (Footnote 3) You've seen [him] only occasionally since he opted for assignment in the Stellar Patrol those five long years ago.
With unconcealed excitement, [Floyd] is hopping around in [bin number three]. [Floyd] jumps up and down saying, "Oh boy oh boy oh boy pick [Floyd] pick [Floyd] pick [Floyd]!"
This is where a Lieutenant First Class would come to obtain a [robot] for use on an important assignment.
A small bedroom with [two beds], one for [each] of your [children]. The illumination [spell], a common [casting] available these days in every home in Darisia, is set very low so as to facilitate their falling asleep.
Far off the side of the road is a huge, dark, mansion sitting on a flat lawn, where a man lives, your newly discovered thief. You are north of this house, and you notice that it has millions of small, circular windows staring [out], but strangely all of the curtains are closed. There is a slightly foreboding air to the house, and a dark path continues to the northeast and another to the northwest, where barking can be heard.
You round the northeast corner, away from the barking noise, and discover some large, sturdy [vines], which appear climbable, leading to the rooftop.
Like every [dog] lover, you investigate the barking, wondering what's the ruckus? You're not certain of the breed so you take a closer look.
You scramble up the strong [vines], pulling yourself up onto the rooftop. The roof is huge. Moonlight reflecting from the attic's [skylight] draws your attention. Take great care on this slippery, slate roof.
You land lightly on an old wooden floor, a millennia's worth of dust softening your fall as you observe your surroundings. You have landed in the attic, surrounded solely by spiders and their webs. The thick spider webs are huge, their spiraling strands of thread flowing [out] like weightless bands with minds of their own. As your eyes adjust to the gloom that not even your flashlight can penetrate, you also notice a large wooden [box] with a loose top over it. There is a heavy, old carpet with a slightly raised edge, covered in dust.
Dropping gently down from the attic's ladder, you find yourself in the master [bedroom]. There is a grand brick [fireplace], powered by a small [key] in the wall, which is turned off. Upon the sparse covers of the king-size [bed], the twisted, strange thief lies, fast asleep, and there appears to be something sticking [out] from under the [bed]. Something else of interest is to the west. There is not a hallway [out] the door, just a creaky, wooden staircase that is no longer in use.
You walk quickly on an unstable [wooden] floor, with floorboards bending ominously under your weight, creaking. You arrive in the living room, which is very elegant, with a long carpet underfoot. Above the fireplace, on the mantle, is a unique, Japanese-style red [box] made of elegant carved wood. To the north is another room.
The main feature of this large, high-[ceilinged] room is the [pool], of course. Some [chairs] are arranged around its perimiter; the back wall is covered with items both decorative and functional.
This is where you keep your [toaster]. You are out of bread, because you made it into toast. You have no other appliances, because they do not make toast. There is a [huge swirling portal] to the east.
WooOOoooOOoooOoOooOOO. It is the ZooOoOOOone of NooOOOOo ToooaoOoast! It is also your living [room]. That is because there is no toast in your living [room]. Or pudding. But that name's taken. But the monkey went north.
You don't know why there's a [Spooky Swamp] in your house -- but you got a great deal from the realtor, so you don't complain! Except when it leaks into the basement! Why is the [swamp spooky]? Because there's a [GHOST] here! [Boooooo]! The monkey went west!
Woo boy that zany house! It's got its [attic] on the ground floor! OK, not really, you've just been climbing up a gradual incline all this time, and now you're almost a full story over where you started from! Also, there's an invisible trapdoor in the floor! And it's open! You know what that means! The monkey went down! THAT DOES NOT SOUND DIRTY!
It is all wet down here! I told you that the Spooky Swamp leaked! Now you are all wet! But your [toast] is not, because you bought a special magic house where [toast] can't get wet! You Are Smart!
It is early, and the [grass] is wet. The [woods] are thin enough that you can see the low, yellow [sun] through the [trees]. Thin trails of [smoke] curl up into the [sky] above.
These are the hunting [woods] of the people. The [ground] is tangled and leafy. You do not know the [woods] as well as Nok or Gal, but you know that the camp is back to the west.
You wade through the pale swaying [leaves] that curl up from the [ground]. [Twigs] break under your feet. A rough path leads east and south from here.
The [trees] are thick and dark here. Low [bushes] grow between them, and you recognise the [berries] that Gal used to bring.
You stand in a gap where there are no [trees]. The leafy plants have been cropped low, and a round [pit] has been dug in the middle of the clearing.
The hole of [dirt and rock] is deeper than you are tall. Your feet stand in wet [mud]. [Sticks and broken branches] are strewn about, and there is a [dead] and bloodied [stag] slumped against the [dirt] wall.
Under overhanging [boughs] the [road] runs southward towards Rhederfeld. Off in the [shadow] of the [trees], the [outer] wall of the [way-shrine] is pierced by a [narrow gated arch and narrower] arrow [slits]. The [chapel dome] rears up just over the wall, offering a glimpse of the shelter within. Without, the [trees] scratch against the [stone] of the [walls, limbs] creaking in the subtly rising [wind].
Without, the [trees] scratch against the [stone] of the [walls, limbs] creaking in the [wind].
Solid stone [walls] rise to meet gracefully above your head. The air is cool and the [tunnel] is dark, lit only by [moonlight] filtering in from the [outer gate]. Its twin, leading inward, is closed.
A short, plain hall, almost a repeat of the tunnel in the [outer] wall through which you entered. This one is truly out of the elements, however, and the sounds of the storm outside are muffled. The coldness of the stone walls is softened by a layer of [deep blue carpet] and a [pair of torches], burning low. In addition to the [sets] of double [doors] at either end of the passage, there are smaller [doors] to the [left and right, set] discretely back in shadowed [alcoves]. The [outer door] is open, but the others are closed.
In front of you, across a narrow strip of grass, sits the [shrine] itself. Although most of the [temple] is two stories high, an enclosure around the main [door] thrusts forward to meet the outer [gate], which stands open in the wall behind you. The walls sweep back to either side of the [door], meeting the higher [dome] of the inner [temple] and leaving large [grassy courts] to your [left and right].
The [chapel doors] are [set] back beneath an overhanging [roof], forming a shallow alcove. The [chapel] itself is a broad, dim room, lit only by the [guttering flames] of a [pair of braziers] at the far end. The [firelight] seems to be reflecting off of something on the floor, but you cannot make out any details from here.
[Echoes]. [Echoes and emptiness]. [Braziers] burn silently, [smoke] staining the [air]. [Pillars] hide the [walls]. The [dome] above is obscured. The temple is dead.
The [firelight] still reflects off the surface of the [pool].
The [inner and outer doors] are open, but the others are closed.
The air is cool and the [tunnel] is dark, lit only by [moonlight] filtering in from the twin [gates] leading inward and outward.
The only [lights] are your [headlights], the [dashboard] and the [sun] setting behind the [storm clouds] ahead, to the west. [Drainage ditches] flank the [road], and, beyond that, stand endless [fields of tall, pale grass].
It's [snowing], but the [ground] is too warm for it to stick.
Gramoveals surround you, and the [plint] reveals a [splingy theroblam]. [Nindles] wort the [slitch], and three [glottish dranbolks] add to the [hummadrummavecity]. A closed [kemby] leads northeast.
It doubles as a greeting [room] for guests. East leads to a study, south leads outside.
This corner [office] might have seemed luxurious to you in a different life. Great [windows] take up more than half of the [outside] walls of the room, looking [out] over the city. A large [gray desk] squats in front of one of the [windows], its surface bare save for a portable [audio player].
The [parlour] is [Aunt Emma's] domain, and is wonderfully comfortable and cosy on cold winter nights, especially when there's a fire going in the [fireplace]. On warm summer afternoons, however, it gets stiflingly claustrophobic.
This is a sidewalk leading to the small [manor] to the west. The [house] looks like a wedding cake and the [trees] in the yard are dead. Your [car] is on the road next to this part of the sidewalk to the south. The morning air is crisp and the sky is gray.
Here in front of the [house], you see it still looks like a wedding cake, but it's not tiered; just a large block [manor] that was once glamorous, but now, it is only morose. The white paint is now faded to a light gray. The front path leads north and your car is just to the east, down the sidewalk.
This is the front walk up to Mrs. Timmons' [manor]. The front [porch] is sunken into the [house] to the north and the sidewalk that leads back to your car is south. Her lawn, impeccable despite the season, is east and west.
You are on the wide front steps of the Timmons' small [mansion]. The front path stretches to the south where it meets the sidewalk and the front [door] is closed to the north. Next to the [door] is a [doorbell].
Decorated with Britney's signature flare. It was her innate sense of style that first made you forgive her that ludicrous name. And here it is displayed to the fullest: deep-hued drapes on the [walls], the [windows] flung open with their stunning view of old Vienna, the faint smell of coffee that clings to everying. Her [easel] stands over by the [windows], where the light is brightest.
Elsewhere in this large [ballroom], there are scores of other [party] guests dressed in all sorts of outlandish [costumes], such as a woman disguised as a peanut butter sandwich.
[Smythe], off to the west, disappears from sight to the south.
The [Astronaut] is now with you near the south [entrance].
The [Astronaut] leaves you, and is now near the center [entrance].

Front [Hall] This is the front [hall], which runs east and west. Entrances to the living [room] are east and west of here, and the entry [hall] is to the south. The [Werewolf] is to the east, heading away from you.
The [Werewolf], off to the east, disappears from sight to the south.
To the east [Linda] comes into view from the south.
[Linda], off to the east, disappears from sight to the north. Senator [Asher] approaches you.
Hall Near Coat Closet This is a north-south [hallway] leading to an outer [door] further north. To the east is a coat closet. Senator [Asher], off to the south, disappears from sight to the east.
North [Hall] The north end of the [hall], at an outer [door]. A landing leading to a [stairway] is east. You can see a covered [walkway] through a jalousied [door] to the north.
To the south Colonel [Marston] comes into view from the east.

West Coat Closet This is a walk-in coat closet that doesn't seem to be in use this evening. There is a large wicker [hamper] at one end of the closet.
Colonel [Marston] is to the south, heading toward the north.
[Michael], off to the north, opens a [door] and leaves your view to the north.
Covered [Walkway] [Rain] falls in a downpour. This covered [walkway] extends east and west from the [hallway] [door] to the [garage]. The [garden] is to the north, and a [door] to the [office] is southwest. Now the [rain] has slowed down almost to a stop. Only a few drops are falling now.
[Garden] This is a [rain]-drenched and soggy [garden]. Against the [garage] to the west is a [doghouse]. Flagstone paths lead northeast and northwest, and a [glass door] leads to the [hallway]. The [Doberman] [pinscher] is here.
Finally the [dog] decides you mean no harm, gives you one last sniff and returns to his [house].
Back Porch This is the back porch. The [kitchen] is to the south, and a flagstone path leads east and west.
North of [House] This is north of the [house] and west of the [garden], where the hill slopes down to pastures and paddocks. To the south is the [house] and to the west the [garage].
This is a [rain]-drenched and soggy [garden].
Covered [Walkway] This covered [walkway] extends east and west from the [hallway] [door] to the [garage].

[Office] This is the farm's [office]. There are filing [cabinets], a large and a small [desk], a personal [computer], a [telephone], a copier, and other expected [office] appointments. There are [shelves] with breeding [books] and other [horsey] reference works. Where [shelves] don't cover the walls, [ribbons and prize] certificates do. All this is overshadowed by the condition of the [room]: [papers] are scattered everywhere, file [folders] spill their contents on the floor and on every horizontal surface, a file of floppy [disks] has been bounced off one wall, and copier [toner] is spilled on the [rug]. The [desks] and file [cabinet] have their drawers open. [Doors] lead out to the north, west, and south. Crumpled on the floor is the fairy [costume's] [mask]. Next to the large [desk] is a waste [basket]. Sitting on the large [desk] can be seen: a manila [folder] There's a [lariat] here.
Media [Room] This is a large [room] with a projection TV and [VCR] at one end. Comfortable [chairs and sofa] are [grouped] around it. A [bookcase] contains a large [library of videotapes]. There is a [telephone] on the [bookcase]. The [hallway] is to the south and on the east is a connecting [door] to the [office].
West End of [Hallway] This is the west end of the main [hallway]. To the west is a [door] leading out of the [house], and there are also [doors] north and south.
This is the farm's [office].

Internal map reference -- Weather [Monitors] Everything is dark.
(It is not quite as dark as you thought. A [sliver of light] under the [door] provides a tiny amount of [light], and your eyes begin to adjust to the near [darkness] ...)
There is plenty of [room] to move around, and the [ceiling] is quite high. You can just make [out] a [shelf] along one of the [walls].
Forest stands around you, a [shadowed] sanctuary of tree and [loam] and your [old, old footprints] upon [moss and fallen leaf].
The [long dusty] [path] leads through [untended fields] up towards [Swineback Ridge] to the [north]. To the south it leads back into the heartlands of the [Kingdom of Lorayne], the [land] you are determined to defend at all costs against the barbarian [hordes] of the Phartipu. A [narrow lane] leads off across the [fields] to the east.
The [path] from the south starts to climb the [ridge] where you expect to find your army encamped. [Worryingly], there's no rear-guard here, no baggage-train, no sentinels posted to greet you. [More] [worryingly], you hear no signs of life from up [above], no singing, no orders being shouted, no clank of weapons on [armour] as troops move about.
The [narrow lane] from the west comes to an end [outside] a [solitary hut] in the midst of the [surrounding] [fields].
The [top] of the [ridge] (which continues to east and west) affords a depressingly good [view] over the [valley below] - depressing because the size of the [enemy camp] is all too apparent. A [path] leads back down the [ridge] to the south, while [piles of abandoned equipment] lie all around.
There's still an excellent [view] over the [valley] from here, although the main part of the [ridge] lies to the west. Further to the east the [land] slopes down into a [wood], but there is a [steep path] round the [wood] to the [northeast]. Several [tents] have been left [abandoned], half-[dismantled] by fleeing deserters;  the only one left standing looks like a [supply [tent]] (immediately to the south).
Although the [valley below] looks [full of enemy [tent]]s, up here on the west [end] of the [ridge] there's only one, just to the south of where you stand, a [large canvas structure] that would almost certainly be the [command [tent]] were there still an army here to [command]. The remainder of the [ridge] slopes away to the west, but the bulk of it lies to the east.
It looks surprisingly bare, [for] a [command [tent]]; perhaps the deserting troops looted it before they left. A [plain wooden table] still stands near the centre, while a [metal] strong-[box] lies in one [corner].
The hole they call a cell reeks of [death]. A small [window] provides the only [light] for the room. The [entrance] to the west is [barred]. The room is just large enough for you to stand upright. In the corner of the room is an uncomfortable looking [bed], with [somebody] lying on it.
Flanked by [Hollerith's] Game Emporium and the [D-Mension], this side alley is a path less trodden by the masses, the preferred thoroughfare of hackers and techno-freaks. Tonight, though, it's oddly silent aside from the occasional rumble of [thunder]. To the south are the [glass doors] through which you first entered, and the concourse joins the [mall's] primary artery to north.
Or the [mall entrance], if you're coming in from the outside, though you don't see anyone quite so unfortunate at the moment.
Typical mall food court. White tables, chairs and tiled floor, filling a dodecagon whose [walls] are a variety of food [counters]. [Everything] from pizza to Mexican to Thai to one of those cookie places where they make the giant decorated chocolate chip deals the size of a Micheleo's mega-deluxe.
In the semi-darkness, rectangular [screens] flash with plethoric eruptions of psychedelic color, illuminating unmanned [controls]. [Speakers] thunder with attract-mode explosions, screams of pain and the smashing of fists and feet against faces. The silent mall opens, tomb-like, to the east, and smaller [doors] stand to the west and north.
It's a narrow dead end here, with [walls] rising oppressively high in three directions. The alley is quite empty, bare even of trash. (Your guidebook warned you: the police are as efficient about litter laws as about [everything] else they do.) You can retreat to the south.
You're in the entrance of a narrow [brick] alley, which runs further in to the north. To the south a [broad street] courses by, congested with [traffic and bicycles], although none of them seem to notice you.
You are in a dim room, bounded by [metal walls], and you sit restrained in a [steel chair]. Across from you is a [desk] covered with [panels of instrumentation]. The [man] faces you from behind it.
(You're sure the police are as efficient about litter laws as about [everything] else they do.)
An large open space, the size of a high-school gymnasium, surrounded by curving, grey-painted metal bulkheads, lit by electric lights. The floor is a maze of [hatches] of various sizes, presumably leading to the oil tanks below. If memory serves, the doors to the west lead to the crew cabins; a steep staircase climbs to the deck. The dark angle you slept in is to the northeast
So this is the deck of a tanker. My, what a large ship! And what a large expanse of ocean around! And what a large rock the ship seems to have struck! And what a remarkably large black [slick] on the surface of the water!
Four [walls]. No doors. A soft light suffusing [everything]. You don't understand "their" technology, but you don't have to in order to live with it. If this could be called living. But you certainly sleep in it. Or rather, on the discomfort of your [bed], made of various scraps of [wood] and bits of [nails]. A [red hammer] sits at the foot of your [bed]. Almost imedieately above your [bed] hangs a [donut] inexplicably tied to the [ceiling]. In one [corner] of the [room] gurgles a [fountain] (at least you think that that's what "they" were trying to make) while in another is a [crowbar].
Your frontyard is full of worthless crap, among them some umbrellas, a foam [shark head], a [pile of rifles], a [letter], and a [trashcan] full of [dead parrots]. It's best not to ask.
Balser's Frontyard is full of expensive flowers littering the cobble stone path to his front [door]. It sickens you. To the west is the [door] to his house. To the north is the path to his [back door].
This is the city bank. The floor is decorated with black and white tiles. The [walls] are adorned with pictures of happy customers. Several rows of velvet ropes lead toward the front desk. Buisness seems slow today.
You are in a clothes store. They have a wide selection of clothing products, including [shirts, pants], and underoos.
You are in the [town square]. To the southeast you see a [supply store] and roads in all major directions.
The supply store contains various everyday [foods and supplies]. An elderly [woman] whirls around the store, dusting and humming a familiar tune. There are exits to the west and northwest.
The main street of the town has [businesses] on [both] sides. The road leads north and south.
This road enters the town to the north and leads to a [cavern] to the south. There are rising [cliffs] on either side of you. It is rumored that a dragon resides in the [cavern].
You hear snoring coming from inside the [cavern].
This is the [entrance] to a large [cavern], reportedly where the town dragon is residing. You can see a road into the town to the north.
From inside the [cavern] you hear the dragon and the mayor's daughter singing a popular tune.
You are in a large [cavern], filled with abandoned articles and painted with various graffiti. On the far side is a [ledge] and an exit to the north.
This street is named in honor of the highest ranking official, the mayor. Fittingly, the town leaders home sits atop a hill to the east. Another [house], a rundown [shack], resides in a gully on the opposite side of the road. To the north you see steep [cliffs] leading up to the greater [mountains]. The road into town is south of here.
The saloon is typical of a small town. A few [men] playing cards, a few [others] leaning against the [bar], with a [bartender] serving. The saloon faces the street to the east.
This is the eastern edge of the [town] and the view is spectacular. The [Mayor's house], to the north, resides on a hill surrounded by beautifully trimmed trees, bushes, and various gardens and walkways. Beyond the outskirts of [town] in all direcitions you see mountains, especially to the nortwest, where fog constantly guards the highest peaks. The [town] itself includes a supply store, a saloon, a run down shack, and various other buildings, indistinguishable from here. Beyond the [town], to the west, you see a very dark forest that meets the mountains miles away. The road narrows to a dirt path heading east and widens to the west.
This is a narrow east-west dirt path leading in and out of town. To the south you see a [steep incline] to the southern [range of mountains].
A nice sunny room for taking afternoon refreshment, with [lace curtains] and a comfortable [sofa]. The library is to the east, the kitchen is to the north, a storage room is to the west and the front [door] is to the south.
A dusty room filled with [bookshelves]. The parlor is to the west.
Dusty and low, cramped and small, as if built for tech-crazy dwarfs. It's surprisingly warm. In the back is some of odd [machine], while a small hatch leads further down.
This is Street St. which is the main and only street in Swisserland City. They only have one street so [things] don't get confusing. To the north is the center of Swisserland City, which is in the middle of the city. To the south are the north [gates]. There are [merchants] here selling lots of [things] and shouting a lot and waving their arms and jumping up and down, and a lot of [people], and a [jeep]. Life in the big city sure is confusing!!!!!
The street is [packed] with [people] here, as well, and the [people] come in a variety of wild shapes and colors. Right here is a [man flying] around with a [jet pack]. Over in this end is a curious [fellow] with a [baseball] for a [head]. Just to your right you recognize the familiar face of [Vermont] the [grape] vendor, standing in front of her box upon which a myriad of [grapes of many] different sizes and colors is laid.
This is the alley of [instant death]. It looks just like a normal alley.
Now the street has ended and you are on the south side of the square. To your north is the more norther part of the square, and beyond even that you can see the northernmost part of the square, to the south of which is the aforementioned not as north as the north part of the square part of the square. The latter part of the square (the part of the square that is to the north of the south part of the square but is not as far north as the north part of the square) is to the north of you, and you can see the evil PRESIDENT'S [box] on a [stick] to your north, in that part of the square (the middle part between the north part, to the north of the middle part between the south and north parts, and the south part, where you are.) The south street heading south is to the south.
The [walls] of your [tent] glow yellow in the [lamplight], your simple [possessions] casting flickering [shadows] on the wall. A [straw bed]; some [skins of water, oil, and wine]; a [small, guttering lamp]--it is simple, but it is enough.
Nestled in the rolling [hills] at the [outskirts of town] is a small [reed hut] belonging to a captured Hittite youth. This is the slave [quarters] for a local Egyptian cattle merchant. The [flimsy door] to the [hut] is closed.
The [slave] breathes steadily next to his unsuspecting [companion]. Within the room itself you can see the [belongings] of the poor family: some [reed sandals, coarse linen clothing], a [grinding stone] and a small [conical hearth].
From the single camera installed in the room, you can see a small area, nearly all of which is taken up by what most of the facility staff had thought of as "you": a non-descript system-access [terminal]. Its screen glows a faint green, now that you are once again active.
Fire rages from [both] the staircase leading upwards and downwards, preventing your escape. Counterintuitively, the [elevator] is your only chance of salvation...if only it were functioning!
We were algophilists, and this was [our] miserable abode. On the occidental periphery of [our] hovel a [portal] led into domains [more] tenebrous.
The [sand] of our Quirtorium was rubescent from our penultimate scourging. This was to be the ultimate.
The foyer is neat and clean thanks to the hard work of the maids. The marble floor shines in the light of the newly installed electric [lamp]. The expensive off-white wallpaper seems to take on a yellow tone. To the south is a thick [oak door] and toward the west, the Parlour.
The [path] is a manicured strip of [dirt] with [hexagonal] stones marking the way. The property's [willow trees] cluster around it using their leaves to shield the [path] from the [weather]. The lawn is well maintained. The door to the [manor] is to the north and the [path] continues south.
The small family cemetery along the cultivated path to the Agate Chapel is small and only has about seven or eight [tombstones]. The plot of land is surrounded by [willow trees] and they lean in as if draping their branches and protecting the spot. A path continues north while east leads to a chapel.
Rincewind sat at a [little table] in a dark corner of the Broken Drum. A [fat and noisome candle] spluttered [above him], casting a dim glow across the [alcove].
The inn was quiet. [Thick, oak beams] arched low overhead and the thin layer of what might once have been [straw] underfoot suggested that it might hide more than just the floor beneath it. An [open doorway] was set in the [Widdershins] wall, beside a [flight of worn steps] which led up to a dingy courtyard. The [bar] was arranged, albeit rather untidily, against the [Rimward] wall.
Rincewind stood at the top of the [cellar steps]. A [rusty, iron handrail] hung limply off the [cracked stone wall], leading precipitously down into the gloom [below].
The cellar was, like the tavern [above], low [ceilinged]. [Various crates and barrels] were [stacked] round the [walls] and a heavy wooden [trapdoor] was set in the roof against the [Widdershins] [wall]. Some steps led upstairs.
The [back street] was dimly lit by the [odd sparking torch]. Apart from a small [trapdoor] in  the [ground] at the [back] of The [Broken Drum], the [street] was completely uninviting, a long stretch of [stone and wood walls], extending [Hubward and Rimward].
[Rincewind] was balanced precariously on the [window] ledge [outside Twoflower's] room. It was, he decided, a very long way down. The pestilent [vista of Morpork]  extended some way to the [river], its aromatic haze obscuring the view of twilit [Ankh] on the far bank. The view of the [street below] was, however, much more breathtaking. A [drainpipe] clung to the wall, almost as tightly as [Rincewind]. But not quite.
The room was [small] and shabby but, to a tourist, quaint. [Rincewind] thought it hateful. A [small], hard [bed] occupied one corner. The [walls] were [bare], save for a [door Turnwise], a [window] and the [odd trickle of water].
A [small] hallway, brightly lit by a row of neon lights. Dark wooden stairs lead upwards, and a [doorframe] opens west into the Living Room.
Your steps don't make any sound on the the [thick], red [carpet].
Before the party [people] invaded it, this was a spacious, cozy room, which one of those big, expensive TV's. Now, you have to wade through thick smoke to escape either eastwards to the hallway or to the Kitchen and the Pool beyond to the South.
You survey the room one last time. Once, there was [life] here. Soon, there'll be no [life] anywhere. That's a cherry on top of your entire career, right there. Yessir.
You are standing by a [bus stop], In. You can go east to a large square. (If you want to go east, just type "go east".) There are also some things here you can examine: the [bus stop], the [street, and yourself]. (If you want to examine something, you just need to type "examine" and then the name of the thing. So if you want to examine the [bus stop], you can simply type "examine [bus stop]". Always examine [everything] you see!)
You are standing in the middle of a big [square]. You can see a [grocery store] to the north, a [little alley] to the south, the [bus stop] to the west, and a [large house] to the east. (Remember, you can go north by typing "go north", and so on. If you want to examine the [house], type "examine [house]".)
You are in the hall of the [large] house, In. A [staircase] leads up, and there is a [door] to the south; you can also go back west. A [big grandfather] [clock] stands here.
This room is dominated by a large [piano and stacks of sheet music].
There is a [large bed] in the [bedroom]. You can go down to the hall.
You have entered the grocery through a door to the south. You can see a [large sack of onions] in one of the corners, and there is some [food] on the [counter].
This is obviously a study: there is a [book case] with lots of [books].
The alley quickly turns [out] to be a dead end. You can go back north to the square.
That about says it all. You're waiting in front of a ramshackle [stall], behind which lounges one of those [ticket hustlers] who prey on careless vacationers not dissimilar to [yourself]. A streetcorner is west of here.
Dense [traffic] flows around the market [corner]. There's a constant din of horns: honking your horn all the time and driving as fast as humanly possible seem to be [traffic] laws here. The ticket hustler's stall is to the east.
O, my Khan! Do you wish to dip into the fine warm [pools], which have been cunningly wrought by your artisans? Or perhaps you wish to step [outside] into the gardens? Can you not smell the sweet incense that burns so delicately in the [braziers] we have hung throughout your perfect dome? Feel the warmth of the [springs] upon your face, the coolness of the stone beneath your bare feet.
This my Khan is the garden we have made you. It has taken the lifetime of many of your devoted servants and their blood has watered your palms. Can you not smell the sweet scents of the flowers, my Khan? Can you feel the cool breeze on your face? The dome we have built you sits at the heart of this paradise, and beside that grows the ancient [tree] that has sat here since time began.
This is your kitchen, small but functional, at the back of your house. A [door] to the south leads [out] to the [porch], while a [door] to the north leads to living room.
You are standing on the top of the hill of the Festeron graveyard, beside the newly-made [marble tomb]. The gates are back to the south.
You are tied hands and feet to this cold [chair], a [pool of water freezing] under you. A [thin layer of smoke] dances on the floor.
A multitude of tiny [portraits, pictures and drawings] hangs on the [walls] of this corridor. The [wallpaper] is [old and scratched], pieces of it ripped aside like thorn skin. The place is very different from the rest of the affluent mansion.
A small room, no space left for a table or anything. Just a [stove], the [burners] and a [sink].
The spacious abode is filled by [light] coming from the ample [windows]. [Sofas and armchairs] rest like kids around a fire, looking at the [short table] between them. A [large fireplace] dominates the northern wall.
You're in the main [walkway]. It's bright and clean with [stores] all around. Pale light glimmers off the polished [tile] like sunlight on water. The quietness of the closed mall floats by as if on the wind. The mall's [exit] is to the southwest.
The glowing letters atop indicate that this restaurant is called "The Cookhouse." There's a light smokiness in the air, and the [tables] are covered in soft-looking [linen [tableclot]]hs. Although, since the mall closed, all of the patrons have left.
You've just sauntered into a salon. Remembering the low [ceiling], you take care not to bump your head. Behind the [reception desk] is a small [display] made up of backlit [shampoos and conditioners] in various shades of translucent blue. Continuing to the west is another room.
The local branch of the Bank of Zork, the largest banking institution of the Great Underground Empire. The walls are redpainted and there is a distinct wash of pine and sandalwood that hovers in the air. Beyond the lobby of the bank, to the north, lies the [vault]. The air there is dark-- almost heavy-- and thick with the scents of fresh paper and silver and copper. A darkened office sits to the south. As with all branches of the Bank of Zork, a [portrait] of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
A small office belonging to the bank's security officer. You scan the room, seeing a [table] and a large bulky [television].
A workshop for making stuffed bears although by now [everything] is put away. The workshop retains a pleasant atmosphere. You should try going west.
In the closet of the workshop, it is mostly dark. Here lie the new [supplies] waiting to be taken out to customers to make new [teddy bears]. [Their] beady [eyes] glisten as they reflect the light from the workshop, [their] bodies deflated in [some] places, bulging unnaturally in others.
This is a good place to sleep. You have the wood [shavings] piled up all thick and comfy.
The corner for drinking. The entrance to the [Habitrail] is just above you.
You're climbing along the [bars] on the northeast corner of your [cage].
This is another place where the [litter] is nice and thick and good for digging. You bury stuff here all the time.
The [litter] here is mostly gone because you get in and [out] of the [wheel] so much. You can go up into the little squeezy space behind the [wheel].
You've worn a little [track] through here by running around in circles.
You're squeezed in between the [bars] and the [wheel] on the southeast side of your [cage].
You're climbing along the [bars] on the southwest corner of your [cage].
You're climbing along the [bars] on the west side of your [cage]. The [cage door] is to the east.
You're climbing along the [bars] on the northwest corner of your [cage].
You're climbing along the [bars] on the east side of your [cage]. The [cage door] is pretty close to you to the west.
You're in a clear orange plastic [tube] that's exactly hamster sized. It goes west to the cage and up to your [Lofty Lookout].
A clear purple plastic dome where [Boo] has made a nice soft [nest]. The [Habitrail tube] goes down from here.
You are at the center of the upper [face]. You can go pretty much any direction: north, south, east and west.

Paul's Parents were rather fond of this small [pool]. In their time, it wasn't filled with bubbling green [acid], though. It is surrounded by some [deck chair] (made of [bones]). The eastern and western garden [walls] are overgrown with [undergrowth], made of [screaming faces], which is quite distracting. A [glass door] leads north to the kitchen. This wasn't necessary for the [southern southern wall], which is quite high, because it borders on a Golf course (Well, it did on Earth. Who knows what horrors await you beyond? Well, [Wally] might).
You are on top of one of the innumberable hills of the [golf] course. You can see the whole [golf] course around you, which is boring as hell. The only interesting thing is a shimmering and whispering [portal], to the east.
The room is small, dark, and smells faintly of [rawhide]. There is a domed exit to the north, through which you can smell autumn [leaves]. A [mastiff] sleeps gently in the corner, something white barely visible behind his heavy curled hide.
Squinting into the [sunlight], you are engulfed in a wildfire of crisping, swirling red and yellow [leaves]. They swirl ferociously around, making you dizzy. You need to get [out] of here quickly. A faded red doghouse peels in the strong sun to the south.
You are inside of your [head], trembling on the convolutions of that pink sponge of yours. I think this [tends] to mean that in a certain way, you've lost control with reality. Above you bends the [dome] of your [skull], with [walls] enameled with gelatine; in front of you, [two] odd sized spheres slowly swivel around their axis - you realize that you can slow the process down, which might show that you still own a bit of your physical means. On the left flank of you body, your hands feel a precious leather [bag]; that's the metrosexual [bag] your mother offered for your 35th birthday. I think something is wrong, without mentioning your current situation.
The room appears completely white: the [ceiling] is white, the [walls] are white, the floor is white and there is no discernable join between the [walls] and the floor.
The room is small, musky, and windowless. A single [light bulb] is hanging overhead, controlled by a [light switch]. A [bed] is pushed in the corner, leaving only a little room for standing. The walls are made of solid gray concrete and are colored by various stains you'd rather not speak of. There is one [hole] in the wall for electricity. A [wooden door] separates this room from the hallway to the north.
There is a strange smell of garlic that infects [everything], including [yourself], growing stronger every second.
Behind you is the entrance that you worked so hard to find. To the north, a craggy passageway leads into the distance, spotted with small [pools of lava and cracks].
The [walls] here are made of stone, covered in [runes]. Most of them are meaningless to you, except for an [inscription] above the [gate] to the north.
As far as kitchens go, this is certainly a kitchen. There is a [table] sitting in the middle of it, surrounded by [chairs]. A [bench] with a [sink] installed sits at the back of the room, with a [window] above it letting light into the room.
Your cluttered, occassionally filthy [bedroom]. To the south is the kitchen.
Small and bright, day or night. The living room is where movies are watched, [video games] are played, and life is lived.
This vestibule connects the exterior of the pyramid to the burial complex inside. Air currents carry in a faint smell of the [outdoors].
This room is given over to a large [statue] of this tomb's tenant, the [pharaoh]-magician Apepsikret.
Based on your knowledge of ancient Egyptian tombs, you are led to believe that this room originally contained the canopic [jars] that housed Apepsikret's internal organs?but judging from the [rubble] on the floor, the [jars] and their contents are long gone.
This room is dominated by a [statue] of Apepsikret's mysterious consort.
This room is unremarkable but for the presence of a [large wooden wheel] mounted in one wall.
You are stranded in a [sea] of chaos. Amidst swirling [colours] that now and again form themselves into geometrical [shapes] and arcane [symbols], you can make [out] some [things] floating around, unhindered by gravity or any other force.
Your [bedroom] is small and cozy. The walls and ceiling are paneled wood, lending the room a certain rustic charm. A door to the South leads to a darkened hallway.
You can see a [toilet] (on which is a [handwritten] [note]), a [shower], a [sink] and a [mirror] here.
Many rainy nights have been wiled away here watching moivies or playing games. North is the dining room. To the west is the front [door].
Though small, this [room] has played host to many great feasts.
Rather bland, the only thing of interest here is the [armoire].
The provincial [kitchen] is stocked with all the modern amenities. It smells of exotic spices and fresh-brewed [coffee].
There is a kitchen to the east, your bedroom to the south, the cloakroom is west of this room and then the box room is northwards. And I almost forgot the front [door] is to the northwest and the office is northeast.
You can see a [mirror] and a [shower] here.
A big [throne] room north of the [main hall, both] right [out] of medieval fantasy, adorned by big [red banners] with the [family crest] on them and [stained glass windows] to the east, north and west. And a [throne], of course. That's where you sit.
The lack of adornment: the sparsity of detail match the morbid nature of this room. The walls are white and bare. There is only one [door]. The focus of attention of anyone luckless enough to be here would be on the [table] on which you rest.
Kitchen This is a filthy kitchen. The [exit] is to the east. On the [wall] near a [counter] are a [refrigerator] and a microwave.
Basement Bare concrete [walls] line a wide [corridor] leading east and west.
Aero [Basement] This [basement] level [room] is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete.
Stairway A dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A [corridor] continues east.
Infinite [Corridor] The so-called infinite [corridor] runs from east to west in the main campus building.
You are standing in the [garden] behind your [family's] [castle]. On this lovely fall evening, it is doing double duty as a [wedding] chapel.
to the north is the cell aisle, past your [rusty] bar door.
He stands beyond the [exit] of the [labyrinth], looking north towards the [patch of light] streaming into the [cave] from the hidden [valley]. The [maze] itself lies to the south and no force on earth will ever make [him] enter that [nightmare] again. The [rough cave walls] widen northwards toward the [exit] and a [faint wailing] can be heard from that direction.
It appears the [gusts of wind] that occasionally blow through this part of the [cave] are responsible for the [wailing]. Every time it [sounds], he can feel the [breeze] blowing from the [hole] high on the [wall and out] the [mouth] of the [cave] to the north. Above the [hole] admitting the [wind], a [cracked stone [outcroppi]]ng hangs precariously. A [building] can be seen in the [valley] beyond the exit to the north and the maze leading here is [back] to the south.
The [hidden valley] appears in all its glory before [him], a small secluded place, not shown on any map, and known only to a select few. He is the [first] to come here in hundreds of years. The [valley] feels [serene and peaceful]. The only [sounds] heard are the occasional [wailing] gusts of [wind] from the [cave] to the south and the rush of water from the [waterfall] to the northeast. [Sparse trees] grow all around the [valley], except to the northwest, where an open [field] lies. To the north stands an [overgrown building]. It can be no other than the [tomb] of the [Alchemist].
A [waterfall] is here, [rushing] down from the [cliff] thirty feet high, gathering in a [small pool] at the [base], and flowing on [back] into the [cliff face]. The water is [crystal clear], showing a [rocky bottom]. There are no plants or fish in the [pool]. The tomb entrance lies to the west and the mouth of the cave leading [out] of the valley is to the southwest.
He stands before the [entrance] to the [tomb] he seeks. The [building] is small and unimposing on the [outside], but stretches rather far into the side of the mountain. Thick [green vines] have grown all over the construction, but the way in is open. Above the [entrance] hangs a [golden plaque] with several [symbols] engraved on it. The [waterfall] is [rushing] down the [cliff] to the east, while to the west lies an open [field]. The way out of the valley is [back] south.
What looked like an open [field] from far away is in fact completely devoid of vegetation. Not even [grass] grows here, leaving a large [circle of bare earth]. In the center of the [circle], a [single tiny shoot] of some [young] plant is pushing feebly through. To the east lies the tomb and the [rushing waterfall], and the cave with its bronze guardians is to the southeast.
The entrance to the south is the only source of light in this [large] chamber, leaving the far corners cloaked in darkness. Still, the only features are well-illuminated. In the center of the room is a [pedestal], with an [old book] on top of it. To either side of the [pedestal] stands a [tall stone] slab covered with writing. Behind the [pedestal] and the [slabs], a ramp leads down into the depths of the tomb. Other rooms can be seen to the east, west, northeast, northwest, and north.
In the middle of the chamber, a [shaft of yellow light] stretches from floor to ceiling, illuminating the [walls].
A long corridor, lit by [torches], stretches from the stairs up to the south to a large stone [door] to the north. The [torches] burn with an eerie [purple] light.
In the middle of the chamber, a [shaft of red light] stretches from floor to ceiling, illuminating the [walls].
In the middle of the chamber, a [shaft of green light] stretches from floor to ceiling, illuminating the [walls].
In the middle of the chamber, a [shaft of white light] stretches from floor to ceiling, illuminating the [walls].
Near [Dave's] old [Honda] you see three other [cars] and a pickup [truck] parked haphazardly. James's [house] stands [out] to the north, the only visible structure in any direction.
More of a patio, really, just south of the front of the [house]. The center is dominated by a large wooden [table] surrounded by [benches]. A low [stone wall] runs around the courtyard, with openings to the garden on the east, a lawn to the west, and the driveway back south.
The garden contains some [flowers], but consists mainly of [succulents].
This is nothing but a stretch of [grass], quite brown from lack of water.
To the west, the [trees] appear to thin.
Four other people stand around the room, all staring at you for an answer. Mr [Bromelle] stands in the left corner by the maroon colored [curtains] with a [large window] behind [him]. It is a dark night [outside]. Mr [Kalburry] is over at the [piano], playing an unmatched beautiful melody. [Sharon] sits on the [cherry wood coffee table] with a lit [cigarette] in her mouth. Every few seconds she takes a puff and then gives you a nasty look. [Jack Haultairya] is near the right side door, perched on one foot leaning up against the wall. He has a hand on the holster for his gun and the other with a [lighter] that he continuously flicks open and closed; flame then no flame. A [roaring fire] crackles behind you with a sudden hiss every once in a while. On the wall is a [clock] that makes a short ticking sound as if foreboding the moment when the time hits midnight. On the floor is a [body], covered in blood with a bullet hole straight through his head.
My [foyer] is a small space with a [doorway] to the south leading to my living room, and a [door] to the north leading to the hall.
The hall of my apartment going from west to east. It is lined with [doors] to other apartments.
The [office] with [Bob] the manager, a [desk] and a coffee machine.
You can see [Door] to [street, Theron] the [alien scout, Mary], My [spellbook], My [car] (empty), an [old man] and a [heavy chunk of gold] here.
Your [cubicle]. With your [computer]. The lunchroom, empty this late, is to the south. The main corridor is west.
Main walkways are north/south with your [cubicle] east.
You see the big glass [door] leading [out] of the office to the west. It's got a keypad, too, just like the Unix lab. You can go east to the kitchen area or north/south to work areas.
There's a [sink] here and a [fridge] too. And a [coffeemaker]. But no [toaster].
This is the least talky of the areas, but only because of the [foozball] game eruptions disturb that. IT's [cubicles] (they get called off-site a lot) are east, and the corridor goes south and also hooks around a bit north.
You like this row. IT works here and they need more space. They're off-site today, but fewer [cubicles] mean less talking. It would be perfect if the foozball room weren't to the west with no other real way to go.
You can go back north to the [cubicles] you already passed. There are managers' offices to the south. You probably don't want to bug them now.
There's a [chessboard] here. There's also a [stack of papers] of old games.
If this room was once intended to welcome guests, it now fails. A darkened [staircase] leads upstairs. To the north, an Turkish [arras] with goldens hangs in an alcove. The west lies a set of French [double doors].
From the king size [bed] and large windows, you gather that this is the master [bedroom].
The butcher block counters are dark with grime. The cabinets have no [doors]. There is no appliance here more modern than an ice box. The unlit stairway leds upstairs. There are [doorways] on the east and south walls.
Even a couple of days after the power failed, this room is still chilly, if not freezing. Between the [cold] and the thawing [bricks of soup and chili] and nacho [cheez], the [freezer] wouldn't be a great place to try to stay for a long time. But the [walls and door] are thick, and impenetrable. As long as the [zombies] don't pull on the [handle] of the [door].
You are in a circular [limestone] chamber, [piles of treasure] slumping near the [walls]. In the center on a tall [pedestal of dolomite] is the [queen], her body decomposing in a [golden] [coffin]. Around the periphery of the room a [spiral staircase] leads far up to a [door] and a [diamond oculus], which lets in light and refracts it. Little [rainbows] dance on every surface.
Winding around, climbing repeating steps, dizzy, you're unsure how much you're swaying and how much the [staircase] is. At the top you steady [yourself] against the [railing] and take in the view of the [tomb] below. [Out] in the center of the [room], the [queen's] [coffin] gleams in the light from a [diamond skylight]. A squat [stone door] blocks the [tomb's] exit.
This is the [smaller] of your two [bedrooms]. You've been sleeping here for close to a year. A [small wardrobe] contains your [folded clothes], a [shallow closet] your [hanging clothes]. A window looks to the east, or would if it weren't [curtained]. [Doorways] go north, into the other [bedroom], and southwest, into your living room. The [door] to the bathroom stands open to the south.
Soft light glows through the milky honeycombs of the [window] glass. In addition to the typical [fixtures], a [dingy white plastic storage chest] with three [drawers] rests on [wheels] here.
You have an adequate but not ideal food-preparing space, a couple of [counters] cluttered with [toaster, coffeemaker], [microwave, recipe box];  all the standard fixtures - [stove, fridge, sink, spice rack, towel rack];  above the [sink] a [fire extinguisher] that's never been used;  you have serious doubts if it works, so hope you never need to find [out]. Openings exist to north and south.
This huge room has [wallspace] for four windows, all [shaded], three [tables], two [bookshelves], an [entertainment] [unit], a [couch], an [easy chair] and a [fireplace]. [Doorways] lead east to your little study, north to the kitchen and northeast to your [current] bedroom. The front [door] gives onto your street.
This nearly-bare room is where you do mental chores like paying bills and [writing letters]. A [table] holds your [old [desktop]] [computer], a [small filing cabinet and set of shelves] contain [papers] of varying importance, a [writing desk] is where you sit when you have something to do in longhand. One [chair] doubles for the [table and desk]. The [bathroom door] is north and an entrance to the living room is west.
The familiar [reed bank] behind your cottage surrounds you, filling the damp space between your home and the [river] to the south.
A small bulge of [sandy] [beach], providing a place to stand comfortably and access the [river water] clear of the [reeds]. The [river] to the south curves gently around it.
A space in front of your [home], long ago cleared from the [reed] bank to the south. You can see the [road] from here, and of course the [forest] beyond it.
You are now in the [garage].
Without warning, lightning flashes outside, and a few seconds later thunder rattles the [house].
The echoes of your presence swell upward to a ceiling you can't even see, and the confines of the [fortress] stretch behind you into darkness. You're just behind the incredibly strong [iron gate], which can be closed and barred, it looks like.
You are standing on Church Approach, which is a little side street off New Romney high street. Opposite you is St Nicholas Church, where you enjoy bell ringing. Nearby is Station Road, where the Marsh Academy (formally called Southlands School) is. To your north is The [Computer] Lady.
This is the entrance of The [Computer] Lady, which repairs [computers], software and just might, put your [computer] in a museum along with those old-fashioned record players and video cassettes. To the south, the [street] can be seen, a reminder that you can get back home whenever you want. To the east is the main office, west is the conference room and north is the place you go if you need to answer the call of nature. A [sign] is attached to the east wall.
This is where meetings, such as training or business meetings are held. In the centre of the room stands a large wooden [table] with ten chairs neatly placed around it, and on one wall is a television screen, where you could, if you wish, project your [computer's] visual display onto it. Yep, cool stuff. To the east is the entrance.
The [toilet], like any other public [toilet] in any workplace, contains the usual fittings, finely crafted for your convenience in Inform 7. You might have to leave quickly if the player has a phobia of such places. To the south is the entryway of The [Computer] Lady.
You are in the heart of the business, the brain of any [computer] repair workshop. It's not like the IT department at the local school, where there's a hatch and someone sitting behind it, it's just a normal generic office. A radio is playing on a little table by the south-facing window, and sunlight bathes the room in soft, yellow light. To the southeast is a tiny kitchen, but customers will be instantly kicked [out] of it if they enter it. The west exit leads back to the entrance of the building.
Opposite you is St Nicholas Church, where the good people of New Romney enjoy bell ringing. Nearby is Station Road, where the [Marsh] Academy (formally called Southland's School) is.
You smell the smoke of the steam trains as you wander through Station Road. "Yes," you think, "this is what tourism should be about: no hotels, no cruises and definitely no jet lag." To the west is the high street of New Romney and to the east the town simply melts away, becoming the Romney [Marsh].
Mud, mud, glorious mud. Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood... Well, actually, there's so much mud here that even the cleverest of hippopotamuses would like to roll around in it like some kind of large dog. The [Marsh] merges into New Romney to the west and it leads towards Greatstone to the southeast. One particular review on TripAdvisor mentioned that, due to flooding in the 13th century, the coastline has been diverted.
A path, winding its way through the Romney [Marsh]. It turns from northwest to south here.
A decently [sized] [bedroom] on the second floor of Grandma's house. The room is sparesly decorated, and you feel a dull [carpet] underfoot. A [door] leads [out] to the northwest.
Staterooms aboard a spaceship, even one as luxurious as the Thaleia, are tight, cramped affairs, and this one is no exception. There is barely enough room for you and the [furniture]. The [door] to the [hallway] is locked tight for now. East is your bathroom.
A crackling [fire] fills [Professor Wilkens'] panelled study with [shadows] which leap and shift, giving you the unpleasant, but absurd, sensation of furtive [things] moving just beyond the edges of your vision.A closed [desk] sits against one [wall]. A single [window] looks out onto the night. The study door is to the east. You can see [Professor Wilkens] here.
A voice buzzes in your head. "Good. We see you've found the points. Keep up the good [work]." A random point slams into your shoulder, giving you a nasty bruise.
A serious [workbench] with serious, finely calibrated scientific equipment spans one wall On the [workbench] are a [blob of play dough] and an [oscilloscope].
Not everyone is complimentary about this [courtyard], or the [house] whose front [door] you now face. "A gloomy set of rooms" it has been called. But it has been your home these many years; it was the site, a decade past to this very day, of the great visions that changed your life [forever]. And so here you stay, and here you expect to end your days. The [door] is north.
The [heavy green brocade curtains] are closed. Your [table] has a few [papers] on it. Your [bed] is ready [for] you. The [door], leading east, is closed.
Buxenhall Gardens is, at least during the summer months, the most popular teahouse in Whitstone. [Patrons] in fancy dress mill about, exchanging the latest gossip and sipping the finest of imported teas. Numerous [tables and divans] are arrayed about the gardens in a studied fashion: pleasingly disordered, yet still allowing easy passage for [women] in wide skirts.
You're in a circular room, with old, worn [stones] set into the [wall]. [Torches] rest in [brackets] on the [wall], lighting the area well enough for you to see. A narrow corridor heads north, and that seems to be the only exit from here.
This is a north-south corridor. Unfortunately, you're not safe here from the descending [ceiling]. The corridor is actually a dead end, so you can only go back to the round room.
This room is a plastic-looking lime green. Doorways lead west and east, and from the south wall you can go [left] or [right].
The front door leading back [out] to the street is to your south, or you could turn around and go [left] or [right].
This is the block. That interesting house is behind you to the [left and right], the street is to the south.
You hear a knock at the [door].
Your nondescript kitchen. Currently the only things here of interest are the [table and chair] and and the pile of [toast] on a [plate] on the [counter].
As for the demonstration, there aren't that many things in here. A colorful descripiton is also missing... The room is dominated by a huge [table].
Unfortunately, there is NO [TOAST] HERE. Perhaps you could do something about it?
You are standing on a wide, bare line cut through the forest. The swath of denuded [ground] is perhaps [three] meters wide, and extends north and south further than you can see. Behind you, to the west, is the wooded area that Premier Cheney declared a "Hazard Zone", and to the east is a dark wood filled with an ominous rustling. That area, he declared a loss.
You are in the toiletworld. As far as you can see, there is toilet; all toilet, all the time, all the places, [each] and every point in the whole of the world, across the whole yawning, infinite cosmos its own toilet, [each] with toilets inside it, [each] further with toilets inside it, further and further inside towards some unimaginable limit. To the west is a toilet. To the east is probably also a toilet. (TODO: add eastern toilet or whatever)
Theres a toilet. Its big and green. Its name is [SecondToiletFirstToiletFirstToiletDoorOne] and its also a door.
The golden wallpaper shines with the radiance of Kraden's wisdom and love. You are literally blinded with awe and clashyness. Squinting, you can see the [outline] of a [wooden box]-shaped thing (HINT: It's a [wooden box]).
The Snack Bar is, strangely, completely empty. Hey, maybe that guy was telling the truth after all. As you turn around to leave, [Draco] pops up from behind the counter. She doesn't appear to have noticed you. Muted cheers and laughing come from a staircase leading into darkness on the west side of the room.
The [man] sits at an outdoor [table] surrounded by swirling [crowds]. He turns a page of his [newspaper] and takes a sip from a [bowl] of steaming [soup].
A [small well] set in the floor is the only fixture in this airy circular [room]. [Light] shines down the [crawlway] that leads back to the surface and seems to reflect [somehow] off of the floor, [walls, and ceiling]. The cut [stone walls] are [broken] by four stately [arches], one in [each] of the cardinal directions.
This is the living [room], the biggest [chamber] of the house. It is decorated with a vast amount of [magical symbols], and is kept clean and tidy. [Bookshelves] line the [walls], filled with ancient tomes of knowledge mostly written in archaic languages few people know. The [windows] are [boarded] from the outside allowing no light to enter the [room].
This is a [small], spartan [sleeping chamber] containing only a [cast bed] and a [burnished victorian nightstand] in it. Its [windows] are also [boarded] from the outside, yet some light shines in through a [small crack] in the [ceiling].
You just moved in with Derek, your boyfriend of [two] years, a few weeks ago, and thus the room is still pretty bare. Between the [two] of you, you've got a [bed] (which you made immediately after you woke up, just like your mother taught you), a couple [dressers], and a [nightstand]. The [walls] are white and bare except for the [mirror], and a pair of [Venetian blinds] block [out] the early morning sunlight.
A small chamber, dimly lit in a [tinge of blue]. It looks like somebody resides in this [room], but you do not know who it is. There is an [iron door] (closed) to the south and a [ladder] leading upwards. It ends at a [hatch] (closed) in the [ceiling]. A [table] is here, and a [chair] next to it. On the [table] you see a [parchment] and a [mug].
You are standing at the side of a busy [road, Logic Avenue], to the west. An endless procession of [cars] prevents you from crossing.
You're in a section of dense [pine] forest at the base of a small mountain. There are [cones] and needles littered about, and the [treetops] chatter with birdsong. The slope continues up the mountain, or back down towards the road.
This is a wide field of untamed prairie. To the east, a mountain rises up towards its summit, while another hill is faintly visible to the west. You also can make [out] a faint trail leading northeast through the brush.
Here at the top the mountain, the wind blows strong and carries the smell of endless summer. There are no trees up here, no tall grass, but bits of [shrubbery] dot the area. The view is remarkable, though;  you can see grassy hills for miles around. A train track clearly extends north into the distance, running away from this mountain.
You're standing on a wide bluff about fifty feet up a small mountain, overlooking a landscape of sun-blasted plains and craggy hills. Below you, a train [track] runs [out] of a narrow [tunnel] though the hill. On the far edge of the bluff you see a strange rock [formation], and a path wanders southwest through the brush.
The edge of the plateau stops abruptly at a chasm that drops nearly one hundred feet. Luckily, there's a [flimsy]-looking rope [bridge] that spans the gap. It stretches westward to another isolated bluff. To the east, the grasses look more inviting.
The staff's jubilant anticipation of the first human [transfer] was now replaced with dread. Why had the [Professor] fallen ill so suddenly? And how callous of the [Overseers] to insist on proceeding without delay! Particularly downcast, and for good reason, was Dr. Stanley Kyle.
At the heart of the Cliffside Underground Research [Laboratory], a [stand of palms], exotic [flowers], teeming [philodendra]--and often a weary [researcher]--bask in the natural light from above. To the south, the open [doors and windows] of the [Lab Commons] recieve the downward-flowing, faintly salty air. Beside an [eastern archway, stands] a [loading platform], from which the [lift's] [guide rails] climb up the [shaft] to the surface far above.
A [ramp] spirals from floor to [ceiling] among [tapering columns of limestone]. As it encircles the cave, it overlooks animal [cages] perched on shorn stalagmites, row upon row of [supply cartons and crates], and a [chimpanzee] [habitat] built into a large natural [recess]. Through a northern opening, the soft hum of machinery emanates, while a warm [breeze] blows in from the west and rises in the cool, subterranean air.
This cavernous workshop houses Professor Nord's masterpiece. Within the endless coils of connective [cabling], the [Machine] looms like a giant mechanical spider. At its heart, a [control panel] faintly flickers. From there, two [great] arms of bundled [cable] extend toward a pair of dimly lit [cylindrical] [chambers]. High overhead, the underside of a [catwalk glints] in the [shadows].
Illuminated by overhead [lamps] and a [floor-length] [window], a cluttered [central table] supports [glassware, dissected mice, and laboratory] [equipment], including a [microscope and vitals monitor]. To the north, there's a shadowy tunnel between [specimen cabinets]. A [southern door] leads to [Morgan's] Quarters, and a [ramp] leads downward.
If you had the time, you might stop to ponder the 10,000 ft high [mountain of books] you are climbing. But time is not something you've got right now.
You have reached the [mountain peak], but there is a sheer drop of thousands of feet down the other side. You have nowhere else to go. Your only options now are either to jump to certain death a thousand feet below or draw your [sword] (which has magically just appeared at your side) and stand your ground against the raging [beast] once and for all...
This is the school's [library]. All four [walls] are lined with [books]. There are windows along the north and east [walls] above the [bookshelves]. You also see some [tables and chairs] here and the [librarian's] [desk] is in the center of the room. An exit is SOUTHWEST.
This is the school's [main] lobby. Long [hallways] lie to the east, west, and north. The school's [main exit doors] are south. There are also [doors] the northeast and northwest.
This is a long east/west [hall]. There are [windows] all along the south side of the [hall] while [lockers] completely line the north [wall].
You're standing just outside the school's main [office]. The [door] is locked, but you can see inside because the entire south [wall] of the [office] is [glass].
This is the west [centrum]. There are doorways in all directions.
This [room] has four sets of [risers] arranged in a semi-circular position around a wooden [podium]. There is also a brightly-finished [upright piano] off to the side of the [podium]. A doorway to the north leads back into the centrum.
This is the [art room]. Four [tables] with eight [chairs] at [each] take up most of the floor area. [Miss Liske's desk] is in a corner. A long [counter] runs the entire length of one [wall]. A doorway lies SW.
This is a long north/south [hall]. [Lockers] line [both] sides of the [hall] with [windows] above them.
You are standing outside the [metal shop]. The [shop] door is locked. You are probably going to take [metal shop] next semester.
This is the [gym]. The high [ceiling] enables the [walls] to have screened windows which run the whole perimeter of the room near the [ceiling]. From the [ceiling], on the east and west ends, [baskets] (for playing [basketball]) are suspended.
You are outside the [counselor's] [office]. The door is locked.
This is the [home] ec room. It is filled with all kinds of familiar items. There is a very well equipped [kitchen] with a [stove, refrigerator], [cupboards], pots and pans. There is also a [sewing] area with several [sewing machines, bolts of fabrics, and spools of thread].
After spending a whole day in the rain by Hadrian's Wall, a tour of McCain castle seemed like a drier way to pass the time. While listening half-heartedly to the tour guide's monologue on the various [paintings] in the room, you stop to get a closer look at a particularly striking [painting] of a young girl with a cocker spaniel. A few minutes later, you realize the group had moved on and left you behind. You are not sure how to catch up with them, nor how to get back to the foyer where the tours began and ended.
You are in what was obviously a library when this castle had been in use. Rows and rows of floor to [ceiling bookshelves] line the [walls]. If you were any younger or dressed properly, you would have tried to climb them. The floor is dusty, with multiple [footprints] indicating the tour continued north. The [door] to the north has [inscriptions] carved across the top. The [door] you entered by is to the south. A [wooden cross] hangs in a space between some [shelves].
A long narrow corridor extends down the hallway to the north, lit by flickering torches placed at decent intervals. [Carvings] of people catch your eye on the [wall]. You notice a [curtain] to your east, where there should be no windows. There are some more [inscriptions] on the floor.
You are not quite sure what this room was used for. From the guidebook you read in the hotel, you are sure the McCains (to whom this castle belongs to) owned a lot of property. Seeing a large [desk], you decide this must have been the [estate manager's] office, where account ledgers were kept and decisions about what kind of sheep to raise, which distiller to use, and what crops to sell were made. Tall windows allow for some light to enter the room on the east. A [door] lead out to the north, and another archway lead out to the west. The corridor extends back to the library to your south.
A light airy room, the conservatory is a marked contrast to the other musty dreary rooms you had seen thus far in the castle. Vines grow in profusion about the pillars and varieties of flowers bloom in abundance. There are several benches grouped in a cluster near the roses. Handy small [tables] where one could place a teacup and saucer while conversing with guests are strategically placed by [each] of the pillars. [Windows] are plentiful, giving you a better view of the grounds. The [door] to the office is to your south and another archways extends to the west.
The bedroom must have looked grand at some point in time. Now it just looks a mess. You are beginning to feel quite disappointed with this tour. The bed looks quite lumpy, and the curtains surrounding the bed are in rags. A pile of broken wood is piled at the foot of the bed. The [ceiling] has a large jagged hole right over the pile. You notice another [inscription] over the bed's headbord. A door leads to the north and a door to the east leads back to the office. A scene from "Tales of Alhambra" it was not.
It is puzzling that the servant quarters would be so near the rest of the castle. Even making allowances for renovation efforts, you are beginning to doubt that this is a genuine Scottish castle from the 12th Century to begin with. This servant quarters resemble a modern day military barracks, except the [walls] were decorated with various [paintings] from Greek mythology. A [painting of Perseus] holding the horrible head of Medusa tower the door leading east and a picture of [Hercules] battling the three-headed dog of Hades over the door leading north.
A gentle breeze ripples the sparse grasses here, under a [blood-red] [sun]. There are many paths. You see [mountains] to the [distant] east. You feel a manly twitching in your thews, enlivened by the freedom of the open country.
The remains of FALLEN TREES are here, overgrown with ferns and surrounding a half-buried shack of once-fine metal, draped with canvas and pocked with rust. You are wise in the ways of these: they are the "space-[ships]" that brought men from dark places in the sky, ere they fell.
Much of the [shack] has been stripped for pieces, no doubt to be sold in God City, far to the west. Only [scraps] remain.
You stand in a dismal [swamp], with the chitter of unpleasant life in every direction. Footing is torturous here, slowed by the grey [murk] sucking at your [sandaled] tread.
The [forest] here is [mucky] and warm, surrounding a [sinkhole] filled with [iridescent], gently glowing [water]. Some huge [PIPES] lead from here into the [ground], and they drip with a similar strange [water]. There is a foul electric [odor] here, and your vision swims. You can feel your body being overtaken by weakness!
This is the edge of a great [cliff], looking over a [vast CHASM] to the south. The [mists] are so heavy within that you can barely detect a [raging river] far, far below.
A high [WATERFALL] cascades down from a [mountain] ridge above, foaming and roaring into a broad [POOL] of clean [water]. The result is a brilliant [PRISMATIC SPRAY]. The setting is very peaceful.
The air is frigid, and the streets are completely empty - there is hardly any [sign] of life here. Even so, you know you are being watched. To your South is the Town Exit. To your North stand the Fields, showing obvious neglect. To your West is a Shadowed Alley; and to your East is the Tavern - the only place that looks remotely welcoming, despite its crude build.
The Eastern Dirt Road hugs the [outer] perimeter of the castle and eventually joins the Western Dirt Road. The most significant (and noticeable) defect that you notice here is the large crack in the [wall]. It runs all the way up the [wall], and the lack of defence here only serves to make you rather uncomfortable. You'd wager that anyone determined enough could sneak into the castle, and remain undetected, if they could only climb up the [Cracked Wall] from here...
The [Castle] Path leads directly to the [Gate] of Trein Hill [Castle]. It seems to be the only way in - or [out] - of this fortress. You find it slightly odd that there are no guards currently patrolling the area. To the North is the [Castle Gate]; and the Fields are to the south.
East of the Main Street, the [tavern] is the only place that appears to be "warm". There are only [five] people in the [Tavern]. In one corner are [three] men, who appear to be the Town [Guards]. The [Barkeep] is sitting at a [table] in the center of the room, though she occasionally looks at the [Drunkard], who is closest to the fireplace. Only the Old [Guard] appears interested in speaking to you.
You're on the set of the latest [Triple Bear Beer] commercial. [William Shatner] is the director and there are eight [topless cheerleaders] on horses riding in circles past the cameras. The [cheerleaders] are actually nude model/dancers wearing red and white wool outfits with the letters BBB on the front.
There seems to be a political [rally] in progress here, with a [crowd] clustered around a [candidate] for [public] office giving a speech. [City Hall] is north of here, a municipal [library] stands to the south, and there's a [public school] to the west.
The machinery of [government] churns further inside, where you're not strictly supposed to go. But at least there's a [rack of government]-[issued pamphlets] you can browse.
An [old-fashioned] [church] stands to the east, and a [purple tent] is to the north.
You're in front of a modern elementary school. Just inside a [fence, schoolchildren] at recess play and shout.
The stacks start to the south. Here, there are some [internet terminals and today's newspaper].
It looks like the fortune-teller isn't in. There's an unattended [crystal ball], though.
The street ends here, with a prominent [natural history museum] to the west and an [art museum] with an [ornate facade] to the east.
An impressive [dinosaur skeleton] stands here to give visitors a good first impression of the place.
An [electronics] [store] is open to the east. To the north, a [billboard] stands over a vacant lot.
Once, there was a business here. Now it's just a low [fence], some [weeds], and the [sky] above.
A large [painting] hangs here as a kind of preview of what's inside.
You're standing at the top of the [broad white steps] outside the [Asimov Research [Laborator]]y. Behind you, the [morning [sunlight]] slants over the [familiar university] [campus]. The foot of the [steps] is occupied by a [milling crowd of reporters].
This is a circular room from which a corridor leads off to the south. An [automatic barrier] blocks the way north.
You're in a short corridor south of the ticket hall. [Two] stairways lead down; one to the west for platform one, the other to the east for platform [two]. A [small notice] is attached to the [wall].
You are on a platform west of a slightly curved and empty [track]. Stairs marked "Exit" lead up and out, and an [electric sign] is hanging from the [ceiling]. Against the [wall] stands an old [vending machine].
You are standing on a fairly long, straight platform east of an empty [track], and at the bottom of a flight of stairs marked "Exit". Hanging from the [ceiling] is a [large electric sign].
[Human and canine corpses] litter the field. A desolate wind kicks up dust which slowly buries the [bodies]. Off to the east, the rest of the [human] forces are engaged in preparation of siege engines.
The [engineers] of your regiment are busy here setting up [catapults], [towers], and whatnot for the attack on the Dogs' last fortress, which [towers] to the east. So far, the [wall] appear impregenable, and the [towers] seem unable to get too close.
You find yourself in the centre of town, looking up at a [projection] on the side of a [church]. You quickly decide that this is an example of modern [art], something so poor that you could have put it together in your [shed]. There's only one option open to you - shut this rubbish down.
Church Street is to the west, and to the south you can see excitable [youngsters] pointing at the [projection].
You are at the far side of the [church].
You are [outside Cardiff Market]. To the east is a [lane]. Looking south you can see the [Hayes], and to the north you can still just about see the [projection].
You are in the [lane] that cuts the church [graveyard] in half.
With the same creativity that has led to a spate of buildings with "Millennium" in the title, [everything] in this part of town is called "St [David's]".
You are [outside] St. [David's Hall]. There is a [rotating sign] here which has a list of acts on it.
You are in the Flavorplex Hyper-mimetic Test [Chamber], where experimental new technologies are evaluated. The [walls] of this [room] are [covered] from floor to [ceiling] with thick, [soft padding]. There's a [window] in the north [wall], and you can make [out] the [outline] of the [door] by which you entered in the south [wall].
The only [window] in the [room] is here, interrupting the [padding] at about 5 feet [above] the floor and continuing almost to the [ceiling].
You are at the [padded door] at the south end of the [room]. There is no handle, or hardware of any kind on this side of the [door]. The [room] is dominated by the presence of a large machine in its center. Standing next to the machine is a supply cabinet.
You are sitting at your [desk] in the very cramped cubicle where you work. To the east there is some standing room.
You are standing up in your cramped cubicle. To the east is a hallway. Peering over your flimsy cubicle [walls] to the north you see - ugh - the area where the marketing people 'work.'
You are standing in the hallway. To the west is your cramped cubicle. South of here is the lobby where the (dreaded) receptionist sits, and to the north lies your [boss's] office.
You are standing in the hallway which continues west. South of here is the service [elevator lobby], a place for [janitors] and caretakers, not Biritzcom employees. The stairwell which exits the building is to the north. A mailroom lies to the east.
You are in what used to be the marketing department, but is now a coding factory, full of [programmers].
Posters announcing emergency financial regulations adorn this [small] branch of the Bank Of Littleton. A crowded [lineup] of tense, impatient people can be entered.
This store is a sign of the times, an unfocussed mish-mosh of pets, [cheap dented soup cans, cigarettes], [electronics], [sports supplies], clothing, and really [cheap food].
A large [window] looks out to the east, down the road where you can see 6 other houses stretching out over the quarter mile of your sparsely populated neighborhood. A [table and chairs] have been left behind by the previous owner (wonder where he is now?) The kitchen is west of here, and the living_[room] is northwest.
You are in the main [living room] of your reclusive [home]. A full-size [fireplace] is on the east [wall], beside which sits a [pile of logs]. The main entranceway lies due south of the west end of this [room], and the dining [room] is southeast (due south of the east end of the [room]).
This is the [entranceway] to your home. The living room lies north, and stretching downstairs to the east is your basement.
This is the lower level of your home. All [ceilings] on this level are about 2 feet above ground level, so during the day, some light gets in through the windows. To the west is a [small] recreation room and to the east lies a multi-purpose pantry / laundry room / storage area.
Ahh, your crypt. It's the same, even after 500 years. Some things, you reflect, never change. [Spiderwebs] coat every surface, including your [coffin]. The secret passageway that will lead you out of here is to the south.
Home sweet home for a '60s throwback bachelor like yourself. Assorted, [but] unimportant [decorations] litter the walls and [ceiling]. To the west is a [door] that, as you fuzzily recall, leads into your walk-in [closet]. To the east is a hallway, that, as you even more fuzzily recall, leads to the kitchen.
You are in a dimly lit room. You have awaken. Quite fast too. Breathing heavily. You had another strange dream once again. It's always about places that look like distant lands, possibly under ground. you are simply unsure how long you've been napping,. You sure do have the time though. Anyway for the past few months you've been having strange and unexplainable dreams. You just had one awhile ago. To your fullest concentration, you can't recall it completely. You have been taking a nice nap, at home in your room. You still think you are dreaming. It's strange you've been awake for awhile and haven't really notice. Sort of like in a limbo. You open your eyes at last. You look about the place you are in. You find that you are in a dimly lit room. Nothing at all like your own home, and bedroom. You get up, rubbing your eyes. Checking again, you shake your head. This has put you in a bit of shock. It sure did cause you to come to your senses. You stand up. You look around. ... You are in a dimly lit room. You're carrying an [old black rucksack]. With nothing else to do, I guess it's about time you start exploring.
You have reached the side of the [water]. The fire like glow is a bit brighter here.
This is a sand path that continues onward, curving still slightly to the side. You notice the strange fire like glow is gone here. You can go Northeast. There is a [Tree] here.
You are at the end of the Sand Path. You can go west through a [door], or back southwest here.
You lie sidewise in [fausty] [water] -- some putrid [puddlepool of disease and rot]. A grim [hole of rot and dank]. Little [light] here. Your sorry fault for arrival here. All wet [walls] and crumbly [brickwork]; some [twenty] foot [belowtown].
Well, it was your [room], now it's yours and [Danny's]. It has a [closet, [Danny's]] [crib], with [Danny] in it and your [bed]. The way [out] to the hallway is to the southwest.
This is the [hallway]. To the south the [hallway] extends to the kitchen, and then to the living room, where Mom and Dad are probably watching TV or something. They always get to stay up late. Back to the northeast is your room, and to the northwest is the laundry room where Mom washes your clothes. The [closet] here is where mom keeps extra blankets and stuff.
This is where Mom cleans your clothes and stuff in the [washer and dryer]. There's a big [laundry tub] here that the [washer] empties in to and some [shelves] where she keeps stuff. The only way [out] is back southeast to the hallway.
You are in a dingy room that serves as the staff room. The walls are a rusty brown and the smell of sulphur, burning flesh and [coffee] granules hangs in the air. At one end is an array of [lockers], and at the other is an old [sofa] and a [coffee table] for the minions of the Underworld to sit and natter in between their evil biddings. A key [cupboard] is mounted on the wall beside endless motivational [posters].
This is quite literally Hell's Kitchen, and it's not very tastefully decorated to be honest. [Everything] is industrial-looking bare grey metal. A [stove] sits against one wall beside a [sink], and a large storage [cupboard] is opposite them. Another damned [poster] is stuck to the wall by the door to the east.
A sign says you are in the South Corridor of the Infernal Regions. The corridor stretches north, whilst a door marked 'Torture Chambers' is east. Noise and heat come from the south, and the smell of coffee emanates from the west exit. [Posters] adorn the otherwise bare walls.
The North Corridor of the Infernal Regions. More damned [posters] are here too! There's a lot of noise coming from behind the [door] to the west and the [elevator] lies north.
This is the [reception] area for the endless torture [chambers] that stretch on into the distance. However you only have clearance to enter [chambers] 1 and 2, the [doors] to which are to the north and south respectively. There is a cluttered-looking [reception desk] near the entrance.
This is the boiler room, where the ambient temperatures of various parts of the Underworld is regulated, and also where the eternally damned are occasionally boiled. There are rows upon rows of [valves, boilers and pipes] all fed by a huge [furnace]. A [sign] is on the wall by the entrance to the east.
You are standing upon a ledge far [above] the Neverending [Gorge] of Eternal Pain. In the vast fiery depths [below] you an incalculable number of tortured souls are constantly screaming [out] in terror. The first time you saw it when you began working here you thought it was really cool, but now the screaming and the heat are just annoying, and the noise levels are probably way [above] established safety levels.
Your [bedroom]. The [shades] are down and only the smallest portion of the [streetlights] is finding a way through the [window] into your room. You can recognize the most important things in your [bedroom]. There is a closed [door] to the west.
You sit at the [wheel] of your [car], the front of which is now wrapped around a large tree. You can hear the dripping of fluids as they escape beneath your vehicle. This [auto] is not going anywhere without a tow truck. Through the [windshield] you see the exterior of a mansion.
You stand at the front porch of a [house]. This old, Gothic mansion casts gloomy shadows all around you. A sharp wind cuts through your flesh to chill your bones. The pounding thunder grows louder and more threatening. A curiously-shaped [knocker] adorns the front [door]. Flanking the front [door] is a [pair of marble statues].
You are inside the mansion's [foyer]. This is a large and luxurious [room], yet it feels strangely oppressive.
This [room] was designed for deep thought and research. Obviously it was once inhabited by a serious man of letters. The harsh silence in the rest of the house is muted in this [room] of contemplation. The east [wall] is completely covered with a [bookcase]. On the north [wall] is a framed [star chart]. A large, well-polished [table] dominates the middle of the [room]. Beside the [table] is an antique [globe].
This [room] is devoid of any aesthetic warmth or beauty. It is purely functional, with no concern for the trivialities of interior design. To the south is the foyer. [Two doors] go southwest and west. One [door] goes east.
A small [painting] hangs between the [two] west-facing [doors]. Near the [staircase] is a framed [sepia-toned photograph] with [some] writing on it.
The [old wooden] floorboards creak under your weight. Your creaking footsteps echo through the emptiness of the huge house. [Doors] lead west, northwest, east, northeast, and southeast. A [stuffed fish] hangs on the [wall] at the end of the [hallway].
This room is like your typical, twentieth century bourgeois [bedroom] -- a place to relax, perhaps? Against the far [wall] is a large [bed]. Next to it is a [dresser]. Hanging over the [bed] is a [small mirror]. A large, old [radio] stands against another [wall]. The only exit is to the south-west.
This must be the [master bedroom]. Interesting decor. There is a stale smell about this room, as if it hasn't been opened for years. Along the west [wall] are a row of [photographs] and a large [wardrobe]. Pushed up against the north [wall] is a large, comfortable-looking [bed]. Beside it is a floor-standing [lamp]. The hallway lies east. Another doorway faces south.
Whoever decorated this [bathroom] certainly had eclectic tastes. There is a large [granite bathtub] at one end of the room and a [marble sink] at the other. The decor could be described as "[African] Art Deco".
The market place has [stalls] arranged around its perimeter. The north side of the square is bordered by the [entrance gate] and boundary [wall] of the Hall, the squire's residence. Your house is along the road to the east, and the dismal bogland trail leads to the west. The southern road leads off to the big town many miles away which is far too distant to walk to.
It is only a couple of hundred yards long, connecting your cottage, hidden behind high [hedges] at the east end, to the market square westwards.
The pretty grassy [track] is bordered by thick [hedges] with many [wild flowers] growing in the [verges].
The end of the lane to your [cottage], which is immediately to the east. Another [cottage], [Orchard Cot], owned by Giles, is up a short track to the south. The market square may be reached down the lane westwards.
Your humble [home]. There is only this one room on the [ground] floor and a bedroom [above] to which [stairs] lead up. The front door is to the west and the garden door to the east. The only furnishings are extremely basic.
Nestling under the [eaves], there's nothing much of interest here except the [bed].
Your [cottage] is to the west and a small [shed] is to the south. The [goat's] paddock has an entrance to the northwest. You can see a [billy goat], some [chickens] and a [rooster] here.
You can see some [tubs] of animal [feed] and a [lead rein] here.
A small [shed] containing [tubs] of animal [feed]...   You can see some [tubs] of animal [feed] and a [lead rein] here.
The typically untidy [yard] of a rural dwelling is full of  [chickens] scratching at the [ground].
A spacious and comfortable room, softly lit through [French windows] (covered by drifty white [drapes], and locked). A [dresser], a [bed] (comfortable but comfortless), a [goban] with matching chairs. Although elegant, the decor is somewhat minimalist in design, and you can't help reading violence into [everything].
This [room] at the [Inn] of the Seven Shields can be charitably described as "[economical]". No windows, filthy floorboards, and little in the way of furnishings. Heck, there isn't even a cot to sleep on! A single [door] leads east. A large, [travel]-worn [trunk] is pushed up against one [wall].
Most of the floor space is taken by a rather [large double bed]. Against the [wall] is a [small table], in front of which is a [chair]. In one corner of the room is a [large closet]. A [door] leads southwest.
You have entered the largest room of the house. There is a [fireplace] in one corner, with a [bearskin rug] in front of it. Also in the room are a [table], an [armchair] and a [sofa]. The front [door] is to the south and [two] other [doors] lead northwest and northeast.
It's rather spartan if you compare it with your home back in Canberra, but you're not really complaining. There is a simple [stove] and a [sink]. [Tiles] with [red and blue [flowers]] on them cover the [wall] between the [sink] and the [cupboard] above it. A [door] leads southeast into the living room.
You are standing on the driveway, in front of the [small cabin] you and your wife bought [ten] years ago, just after you were married. The [cabin's] [door] is north of here, and the road stretches away to the south. All around you, the snow-covered trees of the Black Forest stand silently.
You're standing on a stretch of [road] by your [car]. On the sides of the [road] is nothing but flat, dry ground and nothing to see at all to the horizon. The [sign] you passed a few miles back said it was about 10 miles to the nearest town, the name of which you've already forgotten. Seeing as it's even farther back to the previous town, the only way to go is forward to the east.
You are standing in a [forest]. Before you is the [entrance] to an [ancient black castle]. [Huge stone walls] covered in [moss] and thick [vines] reach high into the [late afternoon sky].
You have found the [castle cemetery], ringed by a restless [forest]. [Old gravestones] poke [out of sour]-smelling [black mud] like so many rotted teeth. An atmosphere of insufferable morbid decay clings to this most unholy of burial [grounds]. A [low, freezing mist] covers the [dank earth].
The [afternoon light] filters slowly down, in long dusty columns, through the [dead] and decaying [forest]. On this gloomy [path], strange sounds echo around you. Giant smothering [vines] cling to [black] and decayed timber. The [trees] creak and crack in the [wind] of a threatening [storm].
You are in a [small forest clearing] in the centre of which is a strange, bubbling [pool]. The [water] itself gives off an unearthly [blue light]. The [light] dances in strange patterns over the nearby [trees]. It must be some kind of rare phosphorescence. Large [mosquitoes] buzz round the bubbling [pond water]. A [forest path] leads EAST.
You have found a very [muddy] [forest clearing]. The [forest] moves restlessly around its edges like a cat waiting to pounce.
You are inside a small, one room hovel. A cottage that is no longer habitable. Forest [vines] have crept inside through broken windows and what remains of the roof. The [Devil's] vine has devoured the inside of this little building. It is so dark you can hardly see.
You stand at the back of the [cottage]. You are surrounded on all sides by the impenetrable and restless [forest]. A [path] leads NORTHEAST to the front of the [cottage].
You stand near the [central] entrance [pyramid] of the Musee du Louvre, a [steel and glass] structure rising over [twenty] meters into the air.
The [room] is small; the same as all the others. But it seems smaller of late. The hall extends to the west.
There is little to be seen here but the [locutory door] to the west and your [room] to the east. North and south both lead to the cold: north to the cloister and south to [outside].
The last hint of shelter against the [outside] world. But it is only a hint. The wind rushes by like a stream of ice water to the south: only the [curve] of the [arch] protects you. The warmth, for as much as it can be called that, of the monastery awaits to the north and the cold of [outside] to the south.
The [locutory] used to be alive with the bartering of merchants and the tales of visiting [brothers], but since the gate was closed, no one has been in here but you. A [small bed] is pushed up against the [wall] for those visitors not permitted residency in the monastery, its tired frame supporting a [light mattress].
In the warmer months, [Brother Matteo] maintains a [beautiful garden] in the cloister. Now there is nothing but a few dead [vines] sticking out from beneath a [blanket of snow]. Still, it has a calm dignity: the wind finds no entrance here. The [colonnade] is broken to the south by the exit to the hall and to the west by the entrance to the refectory. The [brothers'] dormitory lies to the east, between the calefactory in the southeast and the [belltower] in the northeast.
The only [room] at [Saint Cuthbert's] large enough to hold all the [brothers], except for the church, the refectory seems immense. Normally, when you are in here the [place] is alive. Now, the only movement is that of drafts spinning between the [tables and out] to the cloister in the east. Row upon row of deserted [seats] stand testament to the damage inflicted by the plague.
The dead don't eat, or so you've been told. Still, the kitchen is practically empty. [Bare tables] stand with no crumbs on them, and a [hatch] through the floor leads to the [cellar]. The refectory lies to the north.
Dozens of openings line the hall, [each] leading to a separate cell, except for the west, which leads to the cloister. Although there are no doors, the entrances are positioned as such to afford as much privacy as possible. [Brother Matteo's] chamber is to the south, [Ignatius's] to the north, Drogo's newly appointed cell is to the northeast, [Constantin's] is to the southeast, and [Lucca's] to the southwest.
Constantin is one of the few [brothers] with anything in his [room] besides a [bed]. A few [tools] lay next to the door in the northwest; remnants of his life as a [blacksmith]. A smell lingers here: a sour smell.
This [room] is small: the same as all the others. A [bed] is pushed up against one [wall], opposite the door to the northeast.
A [bed] is pushed up against one [wall], opposite the door to the north.
He seems to have made [himself] right at home. The [room] smells of animals and sweat; [scratches] adorn the [bed] and lead [out] the door to the southwest.
Ignatius's [room] does not smell as strongly as the others. He has spent so much time in the infirmary of late, taking care of the sick. He is a braver [man] than you. A [bed] is pushed up against one [wall], opposite the door to the south.
Cedar [pews] line the path from the chancel in the north to the cloister to the south, their surfaces cold. The [ceiling] towers [above] you, its [frescoes] dim in the [candlelight].
Perhaps this is the only [place] at [Saint Cuthbert's] that is a comfortable temperature. Heat blasts at you from the [calefactory] to the southeast, but it is countered by the chill from the cloister to the northwest. No, that isn't right. They do not cancel: their furies are incited by one another.
Positioned directly between the dormitory and your own [room], the [calefactory] warms both, although lately it is less than adequate. While the [calefactory] itself is stiflingly hot, its heat stays confined. Your brow grows damp: your [body], feverish. Slightly melted snow creeps in from the cloister to the northwest.
You have spent [many] a solemn Mass up here, gazing [out] unto a sea of your brethren. Now, all you see is a sea of empty [pews] to the south.
Your [office] is a small austere room with a [bare] floor and a [desk] at the south wall, covered with [piles] of various [work papers]. The [office lamp] provides soft white [light]. At one side of the [desk], your [computer] is humming softly, the familiar sound of the ventilation filling the [office]. Currently, you are sitting behind your [desk], on your old [office chair]. The [office door] is to the east, and there is a closed [window] in the west wall.
Behind the [desk], a forlorn old [chair] looks like it is about to fall apart.
The [hallway] runs north and south. To the west is the [door] to your [office]. Just to the north of where you stand there is a [door] in the east wall leading to the [office] of your supervisor. Further to the north the [hallway] terminates at a large metallic elevator [door]. The floor is covered by a thick red [carpet], and light is provided by [fluorescent] [tubes] in the ceiling.
You are standing just west of the [door] to your supervisor's [office]. The elevator is just a bit further to the north.
This is the [office of Supervisor] [Williams]. It is [significantly] larger than your own, with a nice soft [carpet] on the floor and a big [desk] at the opposite wall.
You are standing in front of the [door] to the [elevator]. It is a large [metallic door] with a [silvery] color. To the right of the [door] is a [button] with an [arrow] pointing down.
You are standing in front of the [elevator door]. Next to it is a [round button] with an [arrow] pointing up. The hallway here stretches to the south, with [walls] made of grey stone and a bare cold floor. The air is cool and dry.
The [interrogation] room is a [small] square chamber whose only furnishing is a [table] in the middle of the room. Grey stone [walls] surround you. Two [chairs] stand at each side of the [table], and a single [lightbulb] hangs from the ceiling, casting a sterile white light on everything. The only exit is the [door] to the south from which you entered.
Great genius, now the cops are after you! Look! There is a [motorcycle] here! You can go west from here.
There is a [bed] here and a [bedside] [table]. Your closet is in the west [wall]. North is the bathroom.
You are at the centre of your house. The front [door] is south of here. There are other rooms in most directions.
The [closet] which contains all your [clothes and things].
It is fairly messy as is the rest of the house. To the north you can see the back [door], leading into the garden. In the corner or the room is your [stove]. Over by the [sink] is a [drawer]. In the centre of the room is a large square [table]. On the [wall] above the [drawer] is a reasonably sized [cupboard]. Over near the back [door] is the [sink].
This is your [little] bathroom. It contains all the usual things.
Its dark and you can't see. Maybe because you don't have [eyes].
A dull institutional room, with a [bed] with [bedside] [cupboard and chair]. A couple of [photos] decorate the [cupboard]. A [window] is on the north [wall]. There is an open [door] to the south. [Gladys] is sitting in the [chair].
You are in the open by a [creek]. [Shafts of sunlight] pierce the shading canopies of the full-grown oaks that arch protectively over it, dappling the [water] and ground with bright and dark circles. Across the [creek] to the west, in the deeper [shadows] pooling directly under the trees, you can also make out the tantalizing [outline of hanging knotted rope]. Northwest, at the top of a [steep slope], a [rickety old shed] beckons.
Full-grown oaks arch over it, thrusting out their gnarled branches like sheltering arms, trying to offer protection from the relentless summer sun. [Shafts of light] pierce their shading canopies, dappling [water] and ground with bright and dark circles. Across the [creek] to the west, in the deeper [shadows] pooling directly under the trees, you can also make out the tantalizing [outline] of a [hanging knotted rope]. Northwest, at the top of a [steep rocky] [slope], a [rickety old] wooden [shed] beckons.
A cool breeze blows off the [water] and brushes against your skin, providing some relief from the oppressive heat.
You are standing in the sultry warmth of the full [sun]. Southeast from this bare [rocky] shelf, a [steep slope] heads downhill to the [creek]. Something smells.
A musty, cool breeze blows off the [water] and brushes against your skin, providing some relief from the oppressive heat.
We like to play and dance in this [place] around the tall [beech], sometimes putting [garlands] on its [branches]. It's a beautiful [place], with the [tree] and the [fountain] and all... some say it's even frequented by the fairies, which is why they also call it the [Fairies' Tree], but I've never seen them myself. Nor have I ventured alone much to the south of here - the [town of Domremy] is to the north.
This [town] is where I was born, me and my brothers and sister - and where I lived my entire life. My [house] is further away to the west; so are the [houses] of some of my [friends] like [Mengette] and Colin. The [church] is in the east - the road to the south leads to the meadow path where we came from.
The "[Handheld Lounge]" (as it's labeled on your map) is just a long [hallway], really. There are bean [bag bed] things lining one side, upon which recline a variety of [geeks]. Along the other side of the corridor is a [line of queueing] [people].
It seems a bit odd to see a large [fountain] in the middle of the cemetery, but here it stands. There is a [statue] of a man in the middle of the [fountain], and it looks like people toss [coins] in the [water] for good luck. Gravesites are to the north, south, east, and west.
You see a [grassy spot]. You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, and northwest.
You are standing [outside] a tool [shed] in the northwest corner of the cemetery. The [shed] seems rickety, but it's strong enough to keep somebody from breaking in. The [shed door] is the only thing preventing you from all sorts of handy tools. You need to go west to get into the [shed]. You can go east to a gravesite.
This is a [gate] that leads to the other side of the wall. The landfill is east. Gravesites are west.
The park is a most excellent place for a walk. At the sound of the word "walk", [Dogbert] jumps up.
This is your small, private library, with gold, blue, black, and white coloring the room. A pleasing little room in a once-familiar space station that's now so strange and unsettling. You can see a [bookcase] here.
This is a modest bathroom with doorways leading east and southeast. You can see a [sink] and a [toilet] here.
The [concrete walls] of this closet are oppressively close, made more so by the smell of [bleach and chemicals] coming from a [filthy shelf] against the far wall. Various [brooms] clutter the room, displaying none of the pleasant tidiness characteristic of the rest of Pine Meadows. All this can be escaped through a [door] to the south.
The picnic is going full blast, which is exactly why you've wandered away from it. It's not that you don't like your new companions; it's just that after weeks of spending each day around them, a noisy weekend [cook-out] isn't the way to relax. Some exploration -- on your own -- is an appealing thought.
The grasses are fragrant under the [sunshine] of a late, late summer afternoon. A [stream] chatters by at your feet, and a [weathered] old [wooden bridge] stretches across it to the east. Beyond the [stream], a scrubby [hillside] stretches upward.
A slope descends to the noisy [stream] to the west. The old [wooden bridge] which spans it leans comfortably against the [bank] at your feet. To the east rises the flank of the [hill], shining in the afternoon [sunlight]; two usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.
Elsewhere in the park, [flowers] lie in hollows and peek out from under the brush. Here you have found a profusion of them. Sprays of white and blue lie everywhere; the [vines] ripple yellow.
A [wide] angular [tongue] juts out from the [hillside]. The park stretches off to the north and west, a vast expanse of bright [meadowland], patched with dark [woods] and stitched with streams that glitter ruby in the [sunlight]. In the distance, a [lake] reflects red fire from the setting [sun].
You are high on the [hill]; it rolls downward and off to the west. Beyond the trees and brush, the [meadows] burn in the incredible [light]. The crimson gold above the [horizon] is met and matched by a green which burns as bright, a living furnace of trees reaching in solemn exaltation to the clouds. The last breeze of the day flicks across your face, still warm with the scents of stone and soil, cool with the flavor of growing things.
The park stretches off to the north and west, a vast expanse of dimming [meadowland], patched with dark [woods] and stitched with dark streams. In the distance, a [lake] glows pale in the last [light] of the [sky].
Beyond the trees and brush, [meadows] fade in the last [light]. Behind you stands the last stony [lump of hill]. A [narrow trail] curves away to the northwest.
The old [wooden bridge] which spans it leans uncertainly against the [bank] at your feet. To the east rises the flank of the [hill], a black shape made of night and rain; [two] usable trails lead up around it, to the south and the northeast.
The one-room cottage you share with your mother is shabby, but clean. An old, scuffed-up [mirror] hangs on one wall; a small [table] has been moved underneath it. In the wall opposite the [mirror] is the [door] that leads [outside].
The bright, pleasant, warm interior of the house contrasts hard with the cold wet darkness outside. The main features of this room are the TV [set] and a big ol' [armchair]. The front door is to the north, the kitchen is to the west, and stairs lead up.
Sleek white [walls] surround your futuristic [bedroom], which has been your abode for as long as you can remember. The room is disorganized enough that you nonetheless never know what's hiding in it. Your large [bed] with its [rumpled sheets] lies in the southwest corner, opposite a [chest of drawers]. A [writing desk] and a [stool] stand next to you, and a [wastebasket] lies nearby. A door leads north to a bathroom, and a western door leads to a hall.
This is a cramped [hallway] on the second floor of your house. [Doors] lead to the northeast, to Roy's bedroom, and to the southeast, to your own. To the north is a balcony overlooking the mountains. A stairway leads south to the first floor.
Your [brother, Roy], makes his living in this spacious [room]. A massive [window] fills the north [wall], and a [large bed] lies next to it. [Roy's] [chest of drawers] stands opposite the [bed]. Across the [room] is a high-tech [computer], emitting a low hum. A door leads south, to a bathroom, and the [room] opens into a hall to the west.
This plain [bathroom's] [walls] are adorned with [porcelain tiles]. A [toilet] stands along the north [wall], and a giant [mirror] fills the western [wall]. A [sink] lies in front of it. Doors lead to the north, to Roy's room, and south, to your own bedroom.
You stand in the [entrance] to your [house], a large yet nondescript [chamber]. Your front [door] is to the south, while your family's entertainment [room] lies to the northwest. A flight of stairs leads upward, and a long [hallway] stretches to the east.
You stand on the sidewalk before your [house]. A flickering [lamp post] dimly illuminates the street, which stretches from east to west. The scene has an austere feel; even your [house] looks somewhat foreboding. Beyond it, you can see a range of mountains, shrouded in fog.
This long, drab [corridor] runs from east to west, back to the entrance to your house. To the north, a [door] leads into your house's kitchen. Your parents' bedroom lies to the northeast, while their bathroom is to the southeast.
You stand atop your house's [balcony] overlooking a serene [mountain] scene. In the distance, you can discern the lofty [peaks], barely illuminated by the [moonlight]. A [sliding door] leads south back into your house, while a [revolving staircase] to the north descends down to your swimming pool.
You stand at the eastern end of the road below a massive [oak tree]. Nestled within the [tree's] branches is your sizable [treehouse], a favorite hangout of yours for years. The paved street ends to the east, and your house is located just west of here.
This dark and plain [treehouse], illuminated only by moonlight, is nevertheless roomy and comfortable. Steadfast wooden boards compose the [walls]. A hole in the ground leads out of the [treehouse], to the moonlit street below.
A comfortable couch spans the north side of this relatively small [family room]. Across from it, a [television] [set] rests on a dresser. To the east, a small [staircase] leads into your darkened basement. The only other [door] leads southeast to the rest of your house.
Your house's dark [basement] is littered with a myriad of various [apparatus] from Roy's chemistry experiments. [Beakers], [flasks, and jars] fill the room's recesses, most of which are broken. The dim light comes from a single [naked bulb] hanging from the [ceiling]. The only exit is to the west, where [stairs] lead back into the main part of your house.
Your family takes pride in this large, comfortable [swimming pool] outside your house. [Lights] pierce the darkness to illuminate its still [waters]. A small inflatable [life preserver] floats in the center of the [pool]. A metal staircase leads north to your balcony; all other exits are blocked by a [high fence].
Like your own, this small [bathroom's] [walls] are covered with porcelain tiles. A [shower] lies in the southeastern corner; next to it is an ordinary [sink].

The light of the evening, creeping in through the closed [window] is a remarkable thing. It turns objects into weakened versions of themselves.

The large yard is full of slightly yellowed [grass], surrounded on all sides by high stone walls. Except to the west, that is, where there is a [wide-open] [gate]. Small doors to the east and southwest lead to the Cafeteria and a [Gatehouse], respectively.
This room is full of prisoners, lounging around and trying not to be noticed. There are a few [benches], and a [counter] where you can get food. You can go west to the yard, or east to the laundry.
A small utility closet. All of the brooms and mops are [out] being used right now. There is a [shelf] just above your head.
Sarah [Winchester] has forgotten being awake. It is night, or predawn morning, and moonless. She is on a [sandy] [strand] extending north and south from here. The [sea] is before her to the east.
You stand in the midst of the small [city of Windhall]. The [road] runs along north and south from here. To the west is [Sir Gunther's] small [house], and to the east lies [Baezil's Bakery]. You can almost taste all the delicious pastries that Baezil bakes fresh every day.
You stand in the cool confines of [Baezil's] [bakery], but unfortunately, it seems [Baezil] has yet to get his [oven] heated. The [many] [trays] still lie bare of any of his wonderful products. Your stomach rumbles at the thought of them.
You stand on the northern edge of the [city of Windhall]. To the west is [Creston's] [potion shop], which is more often than not bare of products, and to the north you can see the small confines of [Kytan's shop and house]. It seems to create a dark and gloomy mood in all who look at it, much like its owner. To the east the [road] ends abruptly on the outskirts of [town]. On the distant horizon lie the mires and wet marshes of the eastern swamplands.
You are directly west of the [swamps] near town. The [ground] here is muddy and little grows here but [gyal grass and jhaka bushes], making the landscape very unpleasant. [Back] to the west, the [road] into town picks up and winds on to the horizon, where it meets with [Kytan's house]. To the east the [swamp] thickens, growing more wet and more dangerous. Off to the northeast, you think you hear the rushing of the [Lyndra River].
You stand at the southern end of the small [town]. To the west lies [Borthur's] [smithy], your [home] and workplace. You can feel the heat of the fires within wafting from the open front [door]. To the east lies Mayor [Mielon and Idah's house], a pleasant [cottage] that is always enjoyable to visit. To the south the [road] ends in the midst of a small field, and beyond you see the great Forest of Ansalon. Standing in the middle of the forest, sticking up through the treetops, looms the [tower] of Nostrophidius, dark and lonely.
This huge room serves as both the [smithy] you work at and the [house] you live in. [Borthur] lives in the [small] room upstairs. The [house] is always intensely hot, but your years of work have left you immune to the scorching heat. The [forge and workplace] lie across from your [bed and sparse] accommodations, and a [staircase] leads up to [Borthur's] quarters.
This is the [home] of the [mayor] and his [wife], and the place where all the town meetings are held. The [fireplace and brick chimney] give the room a quaint coziness, and it is never too hot or too cold. You have spent [many] [days] sitting by the [fire] and talking to [Idah], who never bores you with her [many] tales.
You stand in a small [field] overlooking the surrounding countryside south of the [town]. Rolling [hills] stretch southwest until they meet with the [tree]-covered [Tysis Mountains]. Standing before the [mountains], almost matching their height, looms the [tower] of Nostrophidius. To the southeast, the great [forest of Ansalon] stretches to the horizon.
You stand among [tree]-covered [hills] which disorient your sense of direction and blur your vision. You think to the northwest you can see a rough [path] heading up one of the larger [hills]. To the northeast you can barely see the [field] south of town through the [treetops].
You now walk on a small [path] which winds around the [hills], but you can sense it gradually gains altitude as it continues on. There is a break in the smaller [hills] to the southeast, and to the south the [path] continues up a [hill] that's almost [big] enough to be a [mountain].
The easy [forest path] here is well worn from use by the townspeople and [forest] animals. To the east the [path] has a smaller, lesser-used split, rounding to the southeast. The latter [path] goes far deeper into the [forest] while the main [path] to the east skirts around the edge.
You are over halfway up the steep [hill]. Below you can see the [forest, hills] and town, but you try to keep looking up to keep the thought of falling from your mind. Above you the [trees] begin to thin out, and the [path] gets more rocky. At the top of the [hill] you can make out the [tower] of Nostrophidius, blocking out the [sun].
You are almost at the top of the giant [hill] upon which lies the [tower] of Nostrophidius. The way here is difficult, and it's growing harder to catch your breath at this height. All you can see below is a blanket of green, the southern [forest]. You can't make out the town from this height, which shows you how high up you actually are. You feel severely ill, and your legs are turning to jelly. You hate being up high!
This is the reception area. There is a [sign] here, and a [podium], on which sits a [bell]. There is also a small waiting area with [four] low [chairs] and a [coffee table]. The [door] to the main office lies to the west. On the [coffee table] is a copy of [God's Rude Wireless].
You are walking along a well trodden [path] surrounded by [forest]. [Birds] are singing and a gentle [breeze] sways the [branches] of the [trees].
You are on a [path] beside a [stream]. The [path] ends abruptly in front of you. It seems to continue on the other side of the [stream]. The [water] flows quickly here and the sound of far off rapids can be heard.
The [water], a gaping river now, flows quickly and the thunder of far off rapids can be heard.
You are standing in front of a small [tunnel opening], which leads down. [Light] streams from within it. A [sign above] reads '[Underground']. An [arrow] points down.
This is quite an ordinary [bank room]. It is tastefully furnished with [green plants] and there is a long wooden [counter] which has a thick glass [screen] on it separating the [teller] from the customers. There is a staircase, discretely hidden behind some [plants] by the [wall], leading down. There is also a slightly separated children's corner to the east. Next to the [wall] is a [trashcan]. The [room] is crowded with unpatient customers waiting to go about their business.
There are [Plexiglas [walls]] thanks to which this [corner] of the bank is surprisingly silent. In reality the reason for the [walls] is probably the converse in that their presence makes the bank more quiet. There is a [yellow toybox] on the floor and there are [toys] scattered all around. You can also see a [Mickey Mouse clock] on the [wall].
This is the entrance of Minuteman Foods. A vast array of [aisles] spread [out] in either direction.
As opposed to say, a military or executive shuttle, which would have seats to make the trip comfortable and an in-flight holomovie to ease the tedium of a [three] hour flight from Shanghai. Instead, this is the basic civvie model -- you're densely packed in a [titanium] can with over fifty other Chinese [immigrants]. The cabin reeks of sweat but there is nowhere to go, and at this altitude, opening the [viewing windows] would be the queen of bad ideas.
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, -- By the [grey woods], -- by the [swamp] Where the toad and the newt encamp.
By the [mountains] -- near the [river] Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever, -- By the [grey woods], -- by the [swamp] Where the toad and the newt encamp.
Their [lone waters, lone and dead], -- Their [sad waters, sad and chilly] With the snows of the [lolling lily].
This unfolds before your eyes: A [pumpkin] on a [table] lies.
Between the [train tracks] and the [softball field] there's barely any room for a [trail], and the [bike rack] here is almost lost in the [overgrowth]. Presumably somebody will come by at some point and prune the [bushes], but today you're the only one around.
The bike [trail] turns here, giving as wide a berth as possible to [both] the [softball field] and the [woods]. Cradled in the curve of the [asphalt] is a [pool of rainwater].
What seemed at first to be a clear path has revealed itself as a clinging [morass]. The [mud] squeaks angrily every time you lift a foot; when you step down, it rises up to your ankles. Occasionally it slips beneath you, and you're forced to swing your arms in the air like an idiot to avoid falling on your face in the [muck].
The [stream] runs out of a [culvert] here, from beneath the hill and the [train tracks] to the west. The runoff from last night's storm flows swiftly and musically.
Here is where the curve of the [outfield] [fence] gets close to a small rise in the bike [path]. The [incline] is such that the [asphalt] is a little drier here than it is to the east or west.
The bike [trail] turns from west to south here, and [outside] the curve is a [cozy bench], which for whatever reason sits facing east, toward the [highway].
It's theoretically possible to get across the [highway] here, but you have yet to see it done. The [white] lines of the [crosswalk] are more like a blueprint for an imaginary bridge.
You find [yourself] in a low, damp area, partially hidden from the [road] above. The [stream] runs [out] of the [woods] here and noisily disappears into a [grate] under the [highway].
This clearing is bounded by a [fallen log] on the west side and a [boulder] on the other. The [ground] around the [rock] is littered with [shards of glass]; even with [shoes] on, you watch your steps carefully.
The [bushes] thin [out] near the top of the hill, and in the center of the clearing is a small [tent].
A single beam of sunlight cuts through a hole in the western wall, illuminating a shambolic mass of [books, notepads, and newspapers] strewn across the floor. [Everything] is stained and crumpled by moisture to some degree.
You look ahead with a scrunched-up neck and fail to keep your [shoes out] of the [water]. The [curved] floor is harder to walk on than you would have thought.
Well, looks like you've been reluctantly nominated. If you survive the fall, you might get a chance to solve these [mysteries]...and maybe win a Pulitzer Prize to boot! You've been falling for a long time, and it's almost time to land...for better or for worse.
You are back in room #2, a vast cavern with rough, orange, [fungus]-spotted [walls]. Some of the [fungus] has been [scraped] off the [wall], but it is [slowly] growing back. The roof of the chamber is too high for you to see. A [ridge of stone], almost like a [diving board], extends over the [water] in the middle of the room.
You are back in room #15, a fair-sized dead-end with rough, orange, [fungus]-spotted [walls].
A [thick], wet [fog] fills the chamber and gives the surroundings a dream-like quality.
You are back in room #1, a tiny, cramped dead-end with textured, orange, [fungus]-spotted [walls].
You are back in room #15, a tiny, cramped room with textured, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls]. [Long], hollow [strands of rock] hang down from the cavern roof.
You are back in room #19, a small dead-end with creased, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls].
You are back in room #13, a tiny, cramped cave with polished, orange, [fungus]-covered [walls].
You are back in room #12, a vast chamber with rough, orange, [fungus]-covered [walls].
You are standing on a [cliff] back in room #25, a fair-sized cave with creased, brown, [fungus]-covered [walls].
You are back in room #18, a fair-sized cavern with textured, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls].
You are back in room #4, a fair-sized chamber with creased, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls]. A [light fog] drifts through the cave.
You are back in room #20, a fair-sized chamber with rough, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls]. Some [patches of rock coral] decorate the floor and [walls].
You are back in room #2, a fair-sized cavern with jagged, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls].
You are back in room #13, a tiny, cramped cave with rough, orange, [fungus]-spotted [walls].
You are back in room #10, a tiny, cramped cavern with creased, orange, [fungus]-choked [walls]. A [jumble of broken rock] lies on the floor, presumably from a long-ago cave-in.
An undistinguished [bar], yet the social center of Upper Sandusky.
Well, here you are behind the stage at the XYZZY awards. Unfortunately, you can't see what it looks like, because I don't know, not being a presenter and all. But there's a [trapdoor] in the ceiling which leads to the part of backstage which is actually backstage as opposed to under the stage, but screw it, I don't have time to go back an change the name now.
The ledge widens here at the [mouth] of a deep cave. The light from several flickering [torches] sparkles and dances as it reflects back from the tonnes of [gold coins and precious stones] piled carelessly about.
The "[Hairy Horseman]" [tavern] squats along the cobbled street beside the north gate out of [town]. The low smokey [doorway] beckons enticingly.
The [peasants] have gathered here beneath the tall [castle walls]. The crush of musty bodies prevents movement in any direction.
Outside the [village] the [road] turns eastward into gentle [farmland]. The [village] lies south, and a narrow gap leads into the [forest] to the north-west.
The [forest] edge is thick with [saplings and nettles]. A gap leads out into bright sunshine to the south-east, and the [undergrowth] looks passable to the north and north-east.
Faint [tracks] running north-south and east-west cross here in a [thicket of beech]. Mouldering [leaves] lie thick on the [forest] floor, lending this spot an eerie muffled silence.
The air is still and warm here beneath a [thicket] of young [alders] which green-tint the dappled sunlight so that it feels almost like you are underwater. Leafy openings lead north, west, north-east, and south-west.
The [path] bends north and south-west here beside a small [clearing] in which stands an odd-[looking cottage].
Paths wind down from the west and south, entering the dull gray mist of the [swamp] edge. Huge [willows] draped with sickly tendrils of [moss] stoop low over the oily [mud].
A broad [rocky] [shelf] stretches along the [cliff top] here, free from vegetation. There are panoramic [views] over the [valley], where the distant [mountains] dissolve into a hazy [wetland] at the foot of the [cliff]. Gaps lead back into the [forest] to the south and south-west, while a [rocky] [path] from the west descends eastward toward the [swamp].
Just ahead, the [river] emerges from a [rocky] [gorge] to the west and plunges from a spray-misted [lip] into the [swamp] far below. A jagged tooth of [rock] is all that remains of the [bridge] that must have once spanned the [river] above the [waterfall]. The [forest path] from the south continues east along the [cliff top].
A huge [oak] towers above the surrounding [forest], creating a vast green-lit [cathedral] beneath its lower boughs. Trails lead off to the north, south, west, and north-east, or you might be able to scramble up the [trunk] by means of its many [gnarls and knot-holes].
The [ceiling of leaves] opens here to a sunny clearing with exits in the four cardinal directions.
The rising [ground] here becomes quite [rocky]. Amid stunted [birches] gapes the dark [mouth] of an abandoned [mine]. Traces of [paths] lead back to the east and south-east.
The [forest] ends here at the [edge] of a precipitous [gorge] from which the [river] roars and thrashes. A [fallen] [log] provides a way north across the [chasm].
This small clearing contains an [old] brick [well] at its centre. There are [gaps] in the surrounding vegetation to the north, south, east, and northwest.
You weren't sure what to expect from the [mystic] valley of Shangri-La. You'd heard all the stories of course -- a land of mystery and matchless beauty where life is lived in tranquil wonder, beyond the grasp of a doomed world! That's what it said in the brochure, anyway...
That you are standing [outside] the [caravan] of one of Shangri-La's permanent residents is evidenced by the fact that a tiny section of [garden] has been [fenced] off. The [garden] consists of a small patch of meticulously raked [gravel], with, placed at harmonious intervals, two potted [bonsai trees], three [garden gnomes] (all in the lotus position) and the inevitable [plastic flamingo]. The [door] to the [caravan] is open, revealing a [curtain] of colourful [plastic ribbons] that flutter in the breeze.
You are standing at the foot of the [glacier], a sheer wall of [ice] that would dwarf the tallest skyscraper. For thousands of years it has followed this valley like the world's most doggedly determined [Slush Puppie]. Scattered around are immense [boulders] deposited here by the [glacier] during its inexorable retreat. Who knows what else might have been swept up in this monstrous river of [ice]?
Here, in the foothills of the [mountains] is a meadow of lush [grass], strewn with [boulders] and dotted with tall wild [flowers] that frug and shimmy in the breeze. A pastoral idyll in other words, marred only by the fact that someone has erected a [barn] smack in the middle of it. A windowless wooden [box], this [barn], of no great architectural merit. Daubed above the entrance are the words "Yak [Shed]".
Here, at the foot of the [mountain] you are at last fully able to appreciate its immense size. A rough, twisting [path] becomes a narrow [traverse] that zig-zags its way up the [mountainside], its summit obscured by [mist].
The inside of this tiny caravan is completely bare as befits a [monk's] cell. Only the fitted [furniture] remains, and presumably its owner's few possessions are secreted away in the handy under-[seat storage] areas. The only other feature is the colourful [ribbon curtain] through which you entered.
Here, at the peak of the mountain, perched beneath a snow-covered [overhang], is a 1969 model Sprite Alpine [caravan] in a delapidated state of repair. [Mystic sigils] have been daubed across its rotting sides. Colourful prayer [flags] flap from [ropes] tied to the [awning poles]. Could it be that you have finally found the fabled [Sanctum] Sanctorum of the Dada Lama?
The ballroom chosen for the 2003 Xyzzy Awards has been decorated in luxurious style: [gold leaf] marks the [wainscoting] below the [paintings of famous] IF [scenes], while the [ceiling] has a elaborate [mural] depicting the History of the Implementors. Elegantly-clad [waiters] glide here and there serving [canapes] off silver platters, but all eyes eventually return to the [stage] up front and its velvet [curtain].
In the flickering torchlight, you can make [out] large pieces of metal in the room.
The ceiling of the room is made to mimic the constellations. There are a multitude of [gems] embedded into the ceiling, [each] flicking with light as if they are [stars]. Some are larger than others, some or smaller. Most give off a yellow glow, but there are a few red and blue and white. If only you had paid more attention to the [stars]...
You are in a brightly colored room, full of unimplemented [decorations].
This is where [Drew] does his [stuff] and generally hangs [out]. Vague [piles of junk] lurk in the corners. The [ceiling] roils with a [cloud] of thin [smoke], which spills [out] of the room through the doorway to the south.
A sizeable network of [tunnels] leading to the hidey-holes of your fellow rats branch off from this central cavity. This is an older neighborhood, and the [struts and archways] supporting the [walls] are cobbled together in an [architectural] [patchwork] that would say "building code violation" to an Above-Dweller, but to you it says "home".
These tunnels were built by humans like a hundred years ago to maintain the [pipes] that move pressurized [steam] from their big fancy power plant to all their big fancy buildings. Even close to the floor, the air in here is uncomfortably warm: for humans, with their big fancy heads up near the ceilings, it's probably unbearable. The arched [walls] are made [out] of cracked, ancient [bricks] that would be fun to climb if they weren't lined with all those [steam pipes].
It's about lunch time, and a few rays of sunlight fall directly through the access [grate] above you. A [ladder] underneath conveniently allows the climber to avoid contact with the [steam pipes].
Here the tunnel curves away to the southeast and southwest. A tall [ladder] leads up and [out] of sight.
This well-traveled juncture is where the local [steam] tunnel system links up with the main network, eventually leading back to the power plant.
This is the darkest corner of the tunnels. It seems to have been forgotten even by the maintenance staff. The floor is thickly matted with dead and rotting [leaves].
The nice thing about your own place is that [everything] is exactly where it should be. Other people's burrows are always just a little bit off, you know? But even if your home is a dirty little hole in the ground, at least you can keep it the way you like it.
Inside [Shack] The inside of the [shack] is a shambles. An overturned [table and bench], and a few broken [windows] remain. An [oven] is the only [fixture] that's even recognizable.
You hear a rustling in the [brambles] nearby, and you catch a glimpse of something small and furry as it scurries away.
Shady [Brook] The [trail] ends here.
This is an open field west of a [white house], with a boarded front [door].
A [rubber mat] saying '[Welcome] to Zork!' lies by the [door].
There is no door here, and all the [windows] are barred.
One particularly [large tree] with some low branches stands here.
There is a [pile of leaves] on the ground.
This is a forest, with [trees] in all directions around you.
On the branch is a [small birds nest]. In the bird's [nest] is a [large egg encrusted] with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless [songbird].
Unlike most [eggs], this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed.
You are about 10 feet above the ground [nestled] among some [large] branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
You hear in the distance the chirping of a [song] bird.
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south [wall].
Across the canyon, the [walls] of the White [Cliffs] still appear to loom far above. Following the Canyon upstream (north and northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.
Above you is more [cliff], which still appears climbable.
You are facing the south side of a [white house].
A [rainbow crosses] over the falls to the west and a narrow path continues to the southeast.
You are standing in the center of your laboratory, by the circular chest-level [table] that looks like the stump of a tree. On further inspection, however, the [table] reveals that it is comprised of finely-corrugated steel painted and shaped to mimic natural wood. The [table] sprouts upwards like a mushroom, with an oak [vat] crouching beneath its eaves and a ceramic black [cover], that at one time slid back to allow access to the hollow core. Your [glassware] spans the [surface], and a steel [band] just [below] the [surface] provides [hooks] for tools. Suspended from the [ceiling] horizontally in the center of a rusty [chain], a low oil [lamp] provides a bright yellow-gold [light].
The shallow cave leads out to the northeast and a [shelf of reagents] nestles against the [wall]. You look at the [shelf] closer but nothing strikes you as noteworthy.
You are by the [bookshelf] which fills the [wall]. On the left is a brass [torchiere] that sheds a yellow-gold [light] upon the room, and to the right is an ornate and correspondingly heavy, wrought-iron [bookstand]. The cave's twin exits lead east and west. You look across your massive [bookshelf], its [shelves] buckling under the weight of all your [books], and your situation brings several to your immediate attention: your [formulary], Frye's [compendium] and Rasmun's [book].
The shallow cave leads out to the northwest and a [shelf of reagents] nestles against the [wall]. You look closer and notice: a [fish tank] and a cross-braced [chest].
All your [glassware] spans the [surface], and a steel [band] just [below] the [surface] provides hooks for tools.

The shallow cave leads out to the east and a [shelf] of reagents nestles against the wall.
The main exhibit on the second floor: [Room] 16, south of the mezzanine. A [Jeffreys Tube] runs east into a Star Trek: The Next Generation [room], while a hexagonal [sliding door] to the south blocks the entrance to the bridge of the spaceship "Liberator".
I'm sitting on the [couch] at the moment, it's not those home, sloppy ones, it's more like it was designed for some lab test. Now that you learned to look, can you help me turn on the TV, and before you get frustrated can you find the [remote] too, please.
You are now in one of the [two] interactive [areas] of Vigamus, where you can play old [games]. Going to the south, you can reach the shop.
You are now in the shop. A big [show-case] shows [books and gadgets] of Vigamus. To the north you can see the interactive area, while to the west there's the museum entrance.
You are in the [entrance] hall of Vigamus. To the north there is the big hallway called "Game Zero" which, through a series of show-cases and themed panels, tells the history of video games from its dawn in the 50s to the present. To the east there's the shop, with Vigamus' books and gadgets. To the west, there's the door to the editorial office of GamesVillage.it and Vigamus Magazine.
You entered the editorial [office] of Vigamus Magazine, a big open space with [desks] full of [computers, tablets and paperwork].
South of [House] You are south of the white [house]. There is no door here, and all the  [windows] are [boarded].
You are south of the white [house].
Behind [House] You are behind the white [house], where a [path] enters the forest to the east.
You are behind the white [house], where a [path] enters the forest to the east.
North of [House] You are north of the white [house]. There is no door here, and all the  [windows] are [boarded] up. To the north a narrow [path] enters the woods.
You are north of the white [house].
Canyon View You are atop the west [wall] of a great canyon. From here there is a superb view of the Frigid [River] as it flows out of a dark cavern, flanked by towering white [cliffs]. Below rainbow-clad Aragain Falls, the [river] twists  into a [passage] which is impossible to enter. [Paths] enter the forest to the west and north.
You are atop the west [wall] of a great canyon.
[Forest] Edge You are on a [path] in a dimly-lit [forest]. The [path] heads west  into the heart of the [forest], and to the southeast where the [trees] seem to  thin out.
[Forest Path] This is a [path] winding through a dimly-lit [forest]. The [path] turns a corner  here, heading south and east. One large [tree] with some low branches stands  at the edge of the [path].
[Forest] This is a [forest], with [trees] in all directions.
Clearing You are in a small clearing in a well marked [forest path] that extends to the east and west.
Rocky [Ledge] You are on a [ledge] about halfway up the [wall] of the [river] canyon.
Canyon Bottom You are beneath the [walls] of the [river] canyon which may be climbable here.
[Forest Path] This is a [path] winding through a dimly lit [forest].
Up a [Tree] You are about 10 feet above the [ground nestled] among some large [branches].
Clearing You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on all sides. A [path] leads south.
There is a loud [crackling] noise. Blue smoke rises from out of the [Wizard's] sleeve. He sighs and disappears.
Narrow [Tunnel] You are standing at the southern end of a narrow [tunnel] where it opens into a wide cavern.
Foot [Bridge] You are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot [bridge] crossing a deep [ravine]. The [path] runs north and south from here.
Great Cavern This is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. [Stalactites and stalagmites] of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent [moss], and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow [path] winds southwest among the [stalagmites], and another leads northeast.
Room of Red Mist You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin red mist. The mist becomes blue to the west. You strain to look out through the mist...  You see a small room with a sign on the [wall], but it is too blurry to read.
Room of Blue Mist You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin blue mist. The mist becomes white to the west. You strain to look out through the mist...  You look out into a large, dreary room with a great door and a huge table. There is an odd glow to the mist.
Room of White Mist You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin white mist. The mist becomes black to the west. You strain to look out through the mist...  A strange blurry room is barely visible.
The [Wizard], in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Fierce!"
You rush at the [Wizard], intending to tear [him] limb from limb. The [Wizard] mumbles something under his [breath], and just before you reach [him], he vanishes.
Endless Stair You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the [walls]. To the south is a dark and winding [trail].
There is a great tremor from within the earth. The entire [dungeon] shakes violently and loose [debris] falls from above you.
You are in a small clearing in a well marked [forest path] that extends to the east and west.
This chamber is made of black stone. The [walls] are pocked with age; showing faded [frescos], the subject of which can no longer be determined. The only exit is west, into a long. sloping tunnel that eventually leads back [outside]. The weight of stone presses upon you, and you feel you must be deep underground.
You are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot [bridge] crossing a deep [ravine].
You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin red mist.
You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin blue mist.
You are inside a huge crystalline [sphere] filled with thin white mist.
You are in a tiny room in a building. North lies a big room and a hole is in the ground. [Crates] are everywhere.
You are at the top of the [slide]. The [slide] leads down. All exits but west are blocked by fallen rocks.
You are standing at the edge of a [deep uncrossable] [chasm]. A not-especially-dark passage leads southwest and a [grisly hole] in the floor gives you the distinct feeling of being a one-way trip (one of those "you won't be able to get back up" situations).
This place is absolutely [stuffed] with objects. Every [wall] has an incredible assortment and profusion, too much to number or comprehend. Minuscule slivers of vacancy indicate doors to north and east.
The [chessboard] is almost empty, now that most [pieces] have been exchanged. Its [surface] is perfectly smooth, its 64 [squares] alternatingly deep black and pearly white.
